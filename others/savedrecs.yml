  abstract: The aim of this article is to assess China’s R&D position and status on
    salt lake resources with a method combining bibliometrics with social network
    analysis. Patent data about the mining and usage of salt lake resources harvested
    from the SciFinder database and ranging from 1991 to 2010 is analyzed in this
    paper. The results show that there has been a rapid growth in patent publications
    regarding salt lake resources in the last 20 years, both at home and abroad. This
    is especially true with regard to the extraction and application of magnesium
    and potassium. China’s R&D in this field is worthy of attention, because China
    owns considerable salt lake reserves. The status of R&D groups in China is assessed
    via network analysis, through both Ucinet software and NetDraw software. We use
    separate records from the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD)
    and the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), covering the time span from 2001
    to 2010. A collaboration network is established, and its structure and attributes
    are analyzed with a view to assessing the R&D groups in this field. Results from
    these analysis demonstrated that China stands in a disadvantaged position in the
    implementation of related research and technology; several research groups have
    been formed to explore the mining of salt lake resources; Collaboration is mostly
    still confined to the domestic scene; cross-national collaboration has not yet
    started to grow. Finally, proposals are put forward for the formulation of an
    R&D strategy and for cultivating R&D groups.

  abstract: Bibliometrics are often used as key indicators when evaluating academic
    groups and individual researchers in biomedical research. Citation metrics, when
    used as indicators of research performance, require accurate benchmarking for
    homogenous groups. This study describes the research performance of academic departments
    in the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine using article-level bibliometrics
    for scientific papers published from 2008 to 2012. Eligible publications of all
    academic faculty members were verified from each researcher’s curriculum vitae
    and Web of Science (R) (Thomson Reuters). For 3792 researchers, we identified
    26,845 unique papers with 79,502 authors published from 2008 to 2012. The overall
    mean citations per paper for the faculty was 17.35. The academic departments with
    the highest levels of collaboration and interdisciplinary research activity also
    had the highest research impact. The citation window for biomedical scientific
    papers was still active at 5 years after publication, indicating that the citation
    window for publications in biomedical research is active longer than previously
    thought, and this may hinder the reliable use of bibliometrics when evaluating
    recent scientific publications in biomedical research.

  abstract: The purpose of this article is to present a novel method for combining
    bibliometrics and scenario technique for the sake of conducting technology foresight.
    First, we derive an eight-step scenario approach and add the identification of
    emerging technologies as well as their respective effects on each scenario. Second,
    we illustrate this combined method in the field of personalized medicine (PM).
    Existing literature on method combination often focuses singular challenges and
    benefits associated with the scenario technique. In this paper, however, we integrate
    the results of a bibliometric analysis at each step of the scenario technique.
    Herein, we refer mainly to the co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling
    network. Third, we describe the findings of our case study for every step of the
    application of the scenario technique. In doing so, we offer practical guidelines
    for applying this novel combined method in other contexts. The overall benefit
    of the method combination is the integration of scientifically based information
    that exceeds the knowledge bases of the scenario team and other experts. Most
    notably, the examination of vast amounts of technology-specific information facilitates
    the identification of emerging technologies. Moreover, the combined method allows
    for a more precise projection of future states when narrowing the scenario funnel.
    Using this eight-step scenario approach, we build three scenarios for the field
    of PM, discuss disruptive events, and identify and integrate emerging technologies
    into each scenario. Finally, we explore strategic decisions for various stakeholders
    in the PM field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Emerging industries are attracting increasing attention as they engage
    in innovation activities that transgress the boundaries of science and technology.
    Policy makers and industrial communities use roadmapping methods to predict future
    industrial growth, but the existing bibliometric/workshop methods have limitations
    when analyzing the full-lifecycle industrial emergence, including the transitions
    between science, technology, application, and the mass market. This paper, therefore,
    proposes a framework that integrates bibliometrics and a technology roadmapping
    (TRM) workshop approach to strategize and plan the future development of the new,
    technology-based industry. The dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry
    in China is selected as a case study. In this case, the bibliometrics method is
    applied to analyze the existing position of science and technology, and TRM workshops
    are used to strategize the future development from technology to application and
    marketing. Key events and impact on the development of the new, technology-based
    industry have been identified. This paper will contribute to the roadmapping and
    foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic industry
    researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are one of the most viable technologies
    to achieve the goals of energy saving and environmental protection before a breakthrough
    in battery technology and fuel cell technology. Energy management strategy as
    a key technology of HEVs is studied extensively and deeply to improve the performance
    of HEVs and speed up the industrialization of HEVs. This paper quantitatively
    analyzes and evaluates current research status of energy management strategies
    for HEVs based on bibliometrics for the first time, through content analysis involving
    analysis of author keywords and abstracts. Then qualitative analysis is performed
    for all kinds of energy management strategies that are used in HEVs in detail,
    essential characteristics involving pros and cons, interconnections and improvement
    potential among various energy management strategies are revealed from the view
    of control theory. Finally, latest developing trends in energy management strategies
    of HEVs are presented to improve the performance of HEVs based on above quantitative
    analysis and qualitative analysis, covering driving cycle recognition/prediction
    algorithms, integrated multi-objective, coordinated optimization energy management
    strategies, good balance between computation complexity and optimization performance
    of energy management strategies, fair and credible evaluation system of energy
    management strategies. This paper not only first provides a comprehensive analysis
    of energy management strategies for HEVs, but also puts forward the emphasis and
    orientation of future study, which will broaden relevant researchers’ vision and
    promote the development of a simple and practical energy management controller
    with low cost and high performance for HEVs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed evaluation of type
    2 diabetes mellitus research output from 1951-2012, using large-scale data analysis,
    bibliometric indicators and density-equalizing mapping. Data were retrieved from
    the Science Citation Index Expanded database, one of the seven curated databases
    within Web of Science. Using Boolean operators “OR”, “AND” and “NOT”, a search
    strategy was developed to estimate the total number of published items. Only studies
    with an English abstract were eligible. Type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes
    items were excluded. Specific software developed for the database analysed the
    data. Information including titles, authors’ affiliations and publication years
    were extracted from all files and exported to excel. Density-equalizing mapping
    was conducted as described by Groenberg-Kloft et al, 2008. A total of 24,783 items
    were published and cited 476,002 times. The greatest number of outputs were published
    in 2010 (n=2,139). The United States contributed 28.8% to the overall output,
    followed by the United Kingdom (8.2%) and Japan (7.7%). Bilateral cooperation
    was most common between the United States and United Kingdom (n=237). Harvard
    University produced 2% of all publications, followed by the University of California
    (1.1%). The leading journals were Diabetes, Diabetologia and Diabetes Care and
    they contributed 9.3%, 7.3% and 4.0% of the research yield, respectively. In conclusion,
    the volume of research is rising in parallel with the increasing global burden
    of disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bibliometrics analysis provides useful
    information to scientists and funding agencies involved in the development and
    implementation of research strategies to address global health issues.

  abstract: The discipline of bibliometrics involves the application of mathematical
    and statistical methods to scholarly publications. The first attempts at systematic
    data collection were provided by Alfred Lotka and Samuel Bradford, who subsequently
    established the foundational laws of bibliometrics. Eugene Garfield ushered in
    the modern era of bibliometrics with the routine use of citation analysis and
    systematized processing. Key elements of bibliometric analysis include database
    coverage, consistency and accuracy of the data, data fields, search options, and
    analysis and use of metrics. A number of bibliometric applications are currently
    being used in medical science and health care. Bibliometric parameters and indexes
    may be increasingly used by grant funding sources as measures of research success.
    Universities may build benchmarking standards from bibliometric data to determine
    academic achievement through promotion and tenure guidelines in the future. This
    article reviews the history, definition, laws, and elements of bibliometric principles
    and provides examples of bibliometric applications to the broader health care
    community. To accomplish this, the Medline (1966-2014) and Web of Science (1945-2014)
    databases were searched to identify relevant articles; select articles were also
    cross-referenced. Articles selected were those that provided background, history,
    descriptive analysis, and application of bibliometric principles and metrics to
    medical science and health care. No attempt was made to cover all areas exhaustively;
    rather, key articles were chosen that illustrate bibliometric concepts and enhance
    the reader’s knowledge. It is important that faculty and researchers understand
    the limitations and appropriate uses of bibliometric data. Bibliometrics has considerable
    potential as a research area for health care scientists and practitioners that
    can be used to discover new information about academic trends, pharmacotherapy,
    disease, and broader health sciences trends.

  abstract: In scientometrics, citer behavior is traditionally investigated using
    one of two main approaches. According to the normative point of view, the behavior
    of scientists is regulated by norms that make the detection of citation patterns
    useful for the interpretation of bibliometric measures. According to the constructivist
    perspective, citer behavior is influenced by other factors linked to the social
    and/or psychological sphere that do not allow any statistical inferences that
    are useful for the purposes of interpretation. An intermediate position supports
    normative theories in describing citer behavior with respect to high citation
    frequencies and constructivist theories with respect to low citation counts. In
    this paper, this idea was tested in a case study of the Italian sociology community.
    Italian sociology is characterized by an unusual organization into three political
    or ideological camps, and belonging to one camp can be considered a potentially
    strong constructivist reason to cite. An all-author co-citation analysis was performed
    to map the structure of the Italian sociology community and look for evidence
    of three camps. We did not expect to find evidence of this configuration in the
    co-citation map. The map, in fact, included authors who obtained high citation
    counts that are supposedly produced by a normative-oriented behavior. The results
    confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the clusters seemed to be divided according
    to topic and not by camp. Relevant scientific works were cited by the members
    of the entire community regardless of their membership in any particular camp.

  abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) exploit past behaviors and user similarities
    to provide personalized recommendations. There are some precedents of usage in
    academic environments to assist users finding relevant information, based on assumptions
    about the characteristics of the items and users. Even if quality has already
    been taken into account as a property of items in previous works, it has never
    been given a key role in the re-ranking process for both items and users. In this
    paper, we present REFORE, a quality-based fuzzy linguistic REcommender system
    FOr REsearchers. We propose the use of some bibliometric measures as the way to
    quantify the quality of both items and users without the interaction of experts
    as well as the use of 2-tuple linguistic approach to describe the linguistic information.
    The system takes into account the measured quality as the main factor for the
    re-ranking of the top-N recommendations list in order to point out researchers
    to the latest and the best papers in their research fileds. To prove the accuracy
    improvement, we conduct a study involving different recommendation approaches,
    aiming at measuring their performance gain. The results obtained proved to be
    satisfactory for the researchers from different departments who took part on the
    tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Evaluative bibliometrics compare the citation impact of researchers, research
    groups and institutions with each other across time scales and disciplines. Both
    factors, discipline and period - have an influence on the citation count which
    is independent of the quality of the publication. Normalizing the citation impact
    of papers for these two factors started in the mid-1980s. Since then, a range
    of different methods have been presented for producing normalized citation impact
    scores. The current study uses a data set of over 50,000 records to test which
    of the methods so far presented correlate better with the assessment of papers
    by peers. The peer assessments come from F1000Prime - a post-publication peer
    review system of the biomedical literature. Of the normalized indicators, the
    current study involves not only cited-side indicators, such as the mean normalized
    citation score, but also citing-side indicators. As the results show, the correlations
    of the indicators with the peer assessments all turn out to be very similar. Since
    F1000 focuses on biomedicine, it is important that the results of this study are
    validated by other studies based on datasets from other disciplines or (ideally)
    based on multi-disciplinary datasets. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: This paper attempts to sketch the interrelation between information retrieval
    and scientometrics pointing at possible synergy effects provided by some recently
    developed bibliometric methods in the context of subject delineation and clustering.
    Examples of specific search strategies based on both traditional retrieval techniques
    and bibliometric methods are used to illustrate this approach. Special attention
    is paid to hybrid techniques and the use of ‘core documents’. The latter ones
    are defined merely on the basis of bibliometric similarities, but have by definition
    properties that make ‘core documents’ also interesting and attractive for information
    retrieval.

  abstract: In this position paper, we comment on various approaches to the delineation
    of scientific fields or domains, a typical prerequisite for a wide class of bibliometric
    studies. There is growing evidence that this meso-level, between micro targets
    of typical IR and large disciplines handled by macro-level bibliometric studies,
    takes full advantage of hybrid approaches. Firstly, delineation tasks gain to
    combine the a priori thinking of traditional IR, which typically involves clearly
    targeted expectations, and the a posteriori thinking of bibliometric mapping,
    where the decisions are built on external structuring of the domain in a wider
    context. The combination of the two ways of thought is far from new, with IR increasingly
    building on bibliometric networks for query expansion, and bibliometrics building
    on IR for evaluating and refining its outcomes. Secondly, delineation benefits
    from the multi-network perspective, which gives different representations of the
    scientific topics, usually all the more converging than the objects are dense
    and well separated. Focusing on two basic networks-words and citations-various
    sequences or combinations of operations are discussed. Bibliometrics and IR, especially
    when properly combined in multi-network approaches, provide an efficient toolbox
    for studies of domains delimitation. It should be recalled however that the context
    of such studies is often loaded with policy stakes that ask for cautious supervision
    and consultation processes.

  abstract: 'We describe ongoing research where the aim is to apply recent results
    from the research field of information fusion to bibliometric analysis and information
    retrieval. We highlight the importance of ‘uncertainty’ within information fusion
    and argue that this concept is crucial also for bibliometrics and information
    retrieval. More specifically, we elaborate on three research strategies related
    to uncertainty: uncertainty management methods, explanation of uncertainty and
    visualization of uncertainty. We exemplify our strategies to the classical problem
    of author name disambiguation where we show how uncertainty can be modeled explained
    and visualized using information fusion. We show how an information seeker can
    benefit from tracing increases/decreases of uncertainty in the reasoning process.
    We also present how such changes can be explained for the information seeker through
    visualization techniques, which are employed to highlight the complexity involved
    in the process of modeling and managing uncertainty in bibliometric analysis.
    Finally we argue that a further integration of information fusion approaches in
    the research area of bibliometrics and information retrieval may results in new
    and fruitful venues of research.'

  abstract: Introduction A deeper understanding of supplementary bibliometrics beyond
    the impact factor might provide researchers with a better understanding of the
    citation process. This study presents a multivariate analysis of gastroenterology
    and hepatology journals to evaluate the predictive ability of seven bibliometrics
    in the Web of Science to calculate total cites over a 2-year period. Methods Coincidentally,
    bibliometrics appearing during 2008, 2009, and 2010, with their corresponding
    cites in 2010, 2011, and 2012, were recorded from the Journal Citation Reports
    Science Edition. A linear mixed-effects design using random slopes and intercepts
    was performed on 51 out of 74 journals in the Gastroenterology and Hepatology
    category. Result There was a significant global effect size (R-2 = 0.992; P \<
    0.001), which yielded a total variance of 99.2%. The strongest predictors in the
    model were the Eigenfactor Score and Cited Half-life (P \< 0.001), followed by
    the Number of Articles (P = 0.011) and the Immediacy Index (P = 0.021). The impact
    factor was not a significant predictor. Conclusion The Eigenfactor Score and Cited
    Half-life predictors might be the new standards to assess the influence and importance
    of scientific journals; this approach may help researchers select journals in
    which to publish their work. (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott

  abstract: The traditional peer review process for the assessment of scientific performance
    has been increasingly supported by citation analysis. However, bibliometric methods
    require the use of appropriate indicators to be meaningfully and significantly.
    The trend of performing bibliometric analyses by amateurs is most problematic.Seemingly
    easy to handle tools serve requests of decision makers for impact data and rankings.
    In this article we plead for the application of professional citation analysis
    embedded into bibliometric research. For example, journal impact factors are not
    suitable for measuring the performance of a researcher, because they do not allow
    conclusions about the impact of single papers published in a specific journal.
    The h index measures output (number of publications) and impact (number of citations)
    in one single number and connects both parameters arbitrarily. Instead, percentiles
    are far better suited for measuring the citation impact of publications and researchers.
    Using percentiles, publications of researchers and their citations can be visualized
    as beam plots. Beam plots show at a glance, how productive a researcher has been
    in a specific year and how often his publications have been cited in relation
    to comparable publications.

    related journal articles by: (1) exploring the differences in citations to the
    HTA monographs in Google Scholar (GS), Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and (2)
    comparing Scopus citations to the monographs with their related journal articles.
    Setting: A study of 111 HTA monographs published in 2010 and 2011, and their external
    journal articles. Main outcome measures: Citations to the monographs in GS, Scopus
    and WoS, and to their external journal articles in Scopus. Results: The number
    of citations varied among the three databases, with GS having the highest and
    WoS the lowest; however, the citation-based rankings among the databases were
    highly correlated. Overall, 56% of monographs had a related publication, with
    the highest proportion for primary research (76%) and lowest for evidence syntheses
    (43%). There was a large variation in how the monographs were cited, compared
    to journal articles, resulting in more frequent problems, with unlinked citations
    in Scopus and WoS. When comparing differences in the number of citations between
    monograph publications with their related journal articles from the same project,
    we found that monographs received more citations than their journal articles for
    evidence syntheses and methodology projects; by contrast, journal articles related
    to primary research monographs were more highly cited than their monograph. Conclusions:
    The numbers of citations to the HTA monographs differed considerably between the
    databases, but were highly correlated. When a HTA monograph had a journal article
    from the same study, there were more citations to the journal article for primary
    research, but more to the monographs for evidence syntheses. Citations to the
    related journal articles were more reliably recorded than citations to the HTA
    monographs.'

  abstract: To analyze the performance and quality of intraoperative radiation therapy
    (IORT) publications identified in medical databases during a recent period in
    terms of bibliographic metrics. A bibliometric search was conducted for IORT papers
    published in the PubMed database between 1997 and 2013. Publication rate was used
    as a quantity indicator; the 2012 Science Citation Index Impact Factor as a quality
    indicator. Furthermore, the publications were stratified in terms of study type,
    scientific topic reported, year of publication, tumor type and journal specialty.
    We performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine differences between
    the means of the analyzed groups. Among the total of 207 journals, articles were
    reported significantly more frequently in surgery (n = 399, 41 %) and radiotherapy
    journals (n = 273, 28 %; p \< 0.01). The highest impact factor was achieved by
    clinical oncology journals (p \< 0.01). The majority of identified articles were
    retrospective cohort reports (n = 622, 64 %), followed by review articles (n =
    204, 21 %; p \< 0.001). Regarding primary topic, reports on cancer outcome following
    specific tumor therapy were most frequently published (n = 661, 68 %; p \< 0.001)
    and gained the highest mean impact factor (p \< 0.01). Gastrointestinal tumor
    reports were represented most frequently (n = 456, 47 %; p \< 0.001) and the mean
    superior impact factor was earned by breast and gynecologic publications (p \<
    0.01). We identified a consistent and sustained scientific productivity of international
    IORT expert groups. Most publications appeared in journals with surgical and radiooncological
    content. The highest impact factor was achieved by medical oncology journals.

  abstract: 'This paper introduces author-level bibliometric co-occurrence network
    by discussing its history and contribution to the analysis of scholarly communication
    and intellectual structure. The difference among various author co-occurrence
    networks, which type of network shall be adapted in different situations, as well
    as the relationship among these networks, however, remain not explored. Five types
    of author co-occurrence networks were proposed: (1) co-authorship (CA); (2) author
    co-citation (ACC); (3) author bibliographic coupling (ABC); (4) words-based author
    coupling (WAC); (5) journals-based author coupling (JAC). Networks of 98 high
    impact authors from 30 journals indexed by 2011 version of Journal Citation Report-SSCI
    under the Information Science & Library Science category are constructed for study.
    Social network analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis are applied to identify
    sub-networks with results visualized by VOSviewer software. QAP test is used to
    find potential correlation among networks. Cluster analysis results show that
    all the five types of networks have the power for revealing intellectual structure
    of sciences but the revealed structures are different from each other. ABC identified
    more sub-structures than other types of network, followed by CA and ACC. WAC result
    is easily affected and JAC result is ambiguous. QAP test result shows that ABC
    network has the highest proximity with other types of networks while CA network
    has relatively lower proximity with other networks. This paper will provide a
    better comprehension of author interaction and contribute to cognitive application
    of author co-occurrence network analysis.'

  abstract: The percentile-based rating scale P100 describes the citation impact in
    terms of the distribution of unique citation values. This approach has recently
    been refined by considering also the frequency of papers with the same citation
    counts. Here I compare the resulting P100’ with P100 for an empirical dataset
    and a simple fictitious model dataset. It is shown that P100’ is not much different
    from standard percentile-based ratings in terms of citation frequencies. A new
    indicator P100 ‘’ is introduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

  abstract: In a bid for an eye-catching title, many writers use devices such as interrogation
    and exclamation marks, metaphors, double meanings and vague expressions which
    do not comply with accepted standards in style manuals of scientific writing.
    The purpose of this article is to analyse the lack of accuracy of titles in articles
    on bibliometrics published in biomedical journals and to discuss the effect this
    may have on the reader. A corpus of 1,505 titles included in PubMed and Web of
    Science between 2009 and 2011 and retrieved under the MeSH major topic “bibliometrics”
    and other related terms was analyzed. Different types of inaccuracy were identified
    and a classification was developed and used for this particular study. 23.4 %
    of the titles contain inaccuracies of some kind. Editorial titles show a higher
    percentage of these (11.43 %) than original articles (8.83 %) and letters (3.2
    %), the most frequent being the inclusion of a question in the title (seen in
    30.9 % of the papers), followed by vague and imprecise expressions (17.8 %), acronyms
    (16.4 %) and double meanings (14 %). Many titles fail to comply with the conventions
    of scientific writing. A descriptive title accurately reflecting the content of
    an article would give readers a better idea of its content, help them to decide
    more rapidly whether they want to read it and facilitate retrieval from bibliographic
    databases.

  abstract: Although the research and application of a geographic information system
    (GIS) in bibliometrics remains in its initial stage, several valuable attempts
    have been made in recent years. This paper provides our overview regarding this
    area. We first reviewed the spatial information mining derived from literature,
    including structured and unstructured data. The spatial display and the basic
    spatial operations for the geographic information derived from literature were
    then introduced, demonstrating that GIS can be directly used to construct digital
    libraries. Some literature database websites have begun to utilize WEBGIS to display
    the spatial distribution of an author’s location. Additionally, the spatial distribution
    information can be displayed in various modes with other specialized tools. Potential
    spatial analyses in bibliometrics were then discussed, introducing geostatistical
    and buffer analyses as case studies. Finally, several bibliometric indicators
    attached with research units were investigated. When the quantitative research
    index units are linked with the research spatial position, they can be displayed,
    queried and retrieved spatially. Future work to advance the application and research
    of GIS in bibliometrics is still warranted.

  abstract: Experts have more difficulty identifying reverse salients in R&D because
    of increasing technological complexity and a shortened technology lifecycle. As
    an alternative, we suggest a new and systematic method of identifying and forecasting
    reverse salients using QED (quality function deployment), bibliometric analysis,
    and TIA (trend impact analysis). QED allows users to systematically identify and
    prioritize reverse salients. An integration of QFD, bibliometric analysis, and
    TIA makes it possible to specify key performance indicators of reverse salient
    in order to identify the performance gap between current and market-required performance
    and to make a probabilistic forecast about when reverse salients will be corrected.
    Our method will help managers identify a top priority reverse salient, forecast
    its future, and thus make better R&D decisions with regard to market requirements.

  abstract: 'Background: Biomedical research has grown considerably in the last few
    decades, and the authorship characteristics of the dental literature as a whole
    and of its specialty fields has changed significantly. Unfortunately, the bibliometrics
    of the periodontal literature have not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of
    this study is to investigate the bibliometrics of periodontal literature, assessing
    the geographic origin, study design, and topics investigated in periodontal research
    published from 1995 to 2010. Methods: Articles published in periodontal journals
    during 1995 to 2010 were retrieved through hand search. Inclusion/exclusion criteria
    were applied. The following variables were extrapolated from each article: number
    of authors, study design, topic investigated, financial support, and geographic
    origin. The general linear model assessed the influence of independent variables
    on number of authors per article, and x(2) test assessed the statistical difference
    of the variables over years 1995 to 2010. Results: A total of 2,260 articles were
    reviewed; 2,076 met the inclusion criteria. The number of authors per article
    increased (P \< 0.001) from 4.0 (1995) to 5.1 (2010). The proportion of articles
    published from North America and Europe decreased (P \< 0.001) from 84.3% (1995)
    to 58.6% (2010), whereas for Asia and South America the article proportion increased
    (P \< 0.001) from 13.8% (1995) to 40% (2010). Research targeting prevention and
    treatment of periodontal disease is decreasing (P \< 0.001) in favor of implant-related
    research. Governmental research funding is increasing (P \< 0.001). Conclusion:
    Periodontal research significantly changed during the last 15 years.'

  abstract: As the subject of research excellence has received increasing attention
    (in science policy) over the past few decades, increasing numbers of bibliometric
    studies have been published dealing with excellent papers. However, many different
    methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent papers. The present
    quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out to acquire an overview
    of these methods and an indication of an ‘average’ or ‘most frequent’ bibliometric
    practice. The search in the Web of Science yielded 321 papers dealing with ‘highly
    cited’, ‘most cited’, ‘top cited’, and ‘most frequently cited’. Of the 321 papers,
    16 could not be used in this study. In around 80% of the papers analyzed in this
    study, a quantitative definition has been provided to identify excellent papers.
    With definitions that relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of
    top cited papers (58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected
    (17%). Approximately 23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers,
    there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the
    top 3% (median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by
    the top 10%. With the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be
    possible to identify excellent papers based on an ‘average’ or ‘most frequent’
    practice among bibliometricians.

  abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The relationship between metrics, such as the h-index, and
    the ability of researchers to generate funding has not been previously investigated
    in neurosurgery. This study was performed to determine whether a correlation exists
    between bibliometrics and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding data among
    academic neurosurgeons. METHODS: The h-index, m-quotient, g-index, and contemporary
    h-index were determined for 1225 academic neurosurgeons from 99 (of 101) departments.
    Two databases were used to create the citation profiles, Google Scholar and Scopus.
    The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports tool
    was accessed to obtain career grant funding amount, grant number, year of first
    grant award, and calendar year of grant funding. RESULTS: Of the 1225 academic
    neurosurgeons, 182 (15%) had at least 1 grant with a fully reported NIH award
    profile. Bibliometric indices were all significantly higher for those with NIH
    funding compared to those without NIH funding (P\<.001). The contemporary h-index
    was found to be significantly predictive of NIH funding (P\<.001). All bibliometric
    indices were significantly associated with the total number of grants, total award
    amount, year of first grant, and duration of grants in calendar years (bivariate
    correlation, P\<.001) except for the association of m-quotient with year of first
    grant (P = .184). CONCLUSIONS: Bibliometric indices are higher for those with
    NIH funding compared to those without, but only the contemporary h-index was shown
    to be predictive of NIH funding. Among neurosurgeons with NIH funding, higher
    bibliometric scores were associated with greater total amount of funding, number
    of grants, duration of grants, and earlier acquisition of their first grant.'

  abstract: Quality in Higher Education Institutions is the subject of several debates
    in the academic community in a worldwide basis and various efforts are made towards
    identifying ways to quantify it. In this respect, the use of bibliometrics gains
    significant ground as an effective tool for the evaluation of universities’ research
    output. In the present study, the research performance of the seven Greek medical
    schools is assessed by means of widely accepted and advanced bibliometric indices,
    such as total and average publications and citations, average and median h- and
    g-index with and without self-citations for all the 1,803 academics, while statistical
    analysis of the data was also performed in order to compare the observed differences
    in the mean values of the calculated indices. Considerable effort was exerted
    to overcome all inherent limitations of a bibliometric analysis through a meticulous
    data collection. This large-scale work was conducted both in school and academic
    rank level leading to interesting results concerning the scientific activity of
    the medical schools studied as units and of the various academic ranks separately,
    which can be partially justified with geographic and socioeconomic criteria. In
    general, bibliometrics demonstrate statistically significant difference in favour
    of Crete University medical school, while it was also found that self-citations
    have only marginal effect on the individual’s research profile and the average
    indices. Finally, the useful findings of the present study render the methodology
    adopted of high viability for assessing the research performance of Higher Education
    Institutions even in a broader context.

  abstract: Along with the growth of scientific production, the bibliometric studies
    have become essential, providing relevant information about any domain while identifying,
    highlighting and viewing the scientific knowledge constructed within a theme,
    subject or knowledge area. This article approaches the bibliometric studies under
    the light of metatheory and domain analysis within the knowledge organization
    in information science. domain analysis and metatheory are considered significant
    contribution to bibliometric studies when emphasizing the need for epistemological,
    sociological and historical analyzes, as well as other qualitative approaches,
    encouraging researchers to reflect on the whole composition of the research object,
    by means of different methodological, theoretical and epistemological approaches.
    This study aims at contributing to the discourse of the theoretical aspects of
    bibliometric studies by presenting considerations concerning Hjorland’s domain
    analysis, as well as Ritzer’s metatheoretical approach, featuring discussions
    on major theories of a study field, since these approaches together provide a
    more complete qualitative view upon an area, here, represented by the bibliometric
    studies.

  abstract: Background. Bibliometrics are an essential aspect of measuring academic
    and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for
    measuring bibliometrics, identify the strengths and limitations of methodologies,
    outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery
    performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications
    for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics
    and measures of individual performance. Method. A review of electronic databases
    CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics,
    nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet
    sources and social media platforms were also examined. Results. A number of well-established,
    formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h-and c-indices. Changes
    in publication practices and the use of the Internet have challenged traditional
    metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an
    increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance
    and impact. Conclusions. Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric
    measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended.
    However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic
    and scholarly performance are evaluated.

  abstract: Seemingly endless new technologies are emerging. Mapping out Science and
    Technology (S&T) planning correctly on the national level would help innovation
    shareholders remain current on technological development trends and gain an advantageous
    position among the fierce future competition of the global market. Thus, formulating
    effective S&T planning is significant for a nation, especially for new and emerging
    technologies. This paper proposes an industry S&T planning framework. Different
    from previous frameworks, this methodology’s dynamic is directed in four dimensions
    (nation, technology, industry, risks and impacts), tries to find the key elements
    in a specific technology area, and aims to aid in national S&T planning. China’s
    solar cell industry is employed as the case study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

  abstract: Developments in network technologies, scholarly communication, and national
    policy are challenging academic libraries to find new ways to engage with research
    communities in the economic downturn. Librarians are responding with service innovations
    in areas such as bibliometrics and research data management. Previous surveys
    have investigated research data support within North America and other research
    services globally with small samples. An online multiple-choice questionnaire
    was used to survey bibliometric and data support activities of 140 libraries in
    Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, including current and
    planned services, target audiences, service constraints, and staff training needs.
    A majority of respondents offered or planned bibliometrics training, citation
    reports, and impact calculations but with significant differences between countries.
    Current levels of engagement in data management were lower than for bibliometrics,
    but a majority anticipated future involvement, especially in technology assistance,
    data deposit, and policy development. Initiatives were aimed at multiple constituencies,
    with university administrators being important clients and partners for bibliometric
    services. Gaps in knowledge, skills, and confidence were significant constraints,
    with near-universal support for including bibliometrics and particularly data
    management in professional education and continuing development programs. The
    study also found that librarians need a multilayered understanding of the research
    environment.

    video media is based on videos and their view counts. The h-index is defined as
    the number of videos with \>= h x 10(5) views. The g-index is defined as the number
    of videos with \>= g x 10(5) views on average. When compared with a video creator’s
    total view count, the h-index and g-index better capture both productivity and
    impact in a single metric.

  abstract: The ability of metrics to represent complex information about research
    in an accessible format has previously been overlooked in preference to debate
    about their shortcomings as research evaluation tools. Here, we argue that bibliometrics
    have the potential to widen scientific participation by allowing non-academic
    stakeholders to access scientific decision making, thereby increasing the democratisation
    of science. Government policies from 3 countries (UK, Australia and Spain) are
    reviewed. Each country outlines a commitment to the democratisation of science
    for one set of policies whilst ignoring this commitment when developing parallel
    research evaluation policies. We propose a change in dialogue from whether bibliometrics
    should be used to how they should be used in future evaluations. Future research
    policies should take advantage of bibliometrics to foster greater democratisation
    of research to create more socially-reflexive evaluation systems.

  abstract: Science has recently been accelerating at a fast rate, resulting in what
    has been called “information overload” and more recently “filter failure”. In
    this perspective, journal performance indicators can play an important role in
    journal evaluation. Opinions on the appropriate use of journal-level bibliometrics
    indicators can be divided but they have now long been used as measures in research
    evaluation, and many editors see it as part of their editorial duty to try and
    improve bibliometrics indicators and rankings for their journal. There are various
    techniques through which this can be attempted, some more ethical than others.
    Some editors may try to boost the bibliometrics performance of their journals
    through gratuitous citations. This is problematic because citations are meant
    to provide useful references, scientifically justifiable, to previously published
    literature. As such citations can be used as widely accepted measures of scientific
    impact. Therefore, superfluous citations can distort the validity of bibliometrics
    indicators. It might be tempting to try to improve a journal’s bibliometrics rankings
    at all costs, but these are only as meaningful as the data that feed into them.
    Exceedingly inflated indicators due to unethical behaviours can damage the reputation
    of a journal and its editors, and can lead to a loss of quality manuscript submissions,
    which in turn is likely to affect the journal’s future citation impact. (C) 2013

  abstract: One of the most significant inaccuracies of bibliometric databases is
    that of omitted citations, namely, missing electronic links between a paper of
    interest and some citing papers, which are (or should be) covered by the database.
    This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating a database’s omitted-citation
    rate, based on the combined use of 2 or more bibliometric databases. A statistical
    model is also presented for (a) estimating the true number of citations received
    by individual papers or sets of papers, and (b) defining an appropriate confidence
    interval. The proposed approach could represent a first step towards the definition
    of a standard for evaluating the accuracy level of databases.

  abstract: Pharmacology/pharmacy is an important scientific field and plays a pivotal
    role in new drug research and development. China has steadily increased investment
    in drug development. This study aimed to evaluate the productivity of China in
    the field pharmacology/pharmacy in the past decade in relation to ten representative
    countries. The publications in the field pharmacology/pharmacy of China and ten
    representative countries in the past decade (2001-2010) were retrieved from Web
    of Science database, and studies were conducted on the immediacy index of articles
    published in 2011. Multiple bibliometric indicators were obtained from the “InCites”
    analysis. Most of the bibliometric indicators for the developed countries including
    the USA and the European countries remained stable in the past decade. The number
    of publications by the Asian countries, especially China, increased dramatically
    in the past decade year by year; however, the Asian countries improved little
    in the indicators assessing the scientific quality of publications including the
    citation behaviors and the impact relative to either country and subject area.
    It may need a long time to fill in the gap, in terms of the scientific quality,
    between the developing countries and the developed countries. In view of the dramatic
    increase in the financial investment, our findings suggest that the development
    of the field pharmacology/pharmacy worldwide is not optimistic, which may partially
    explain the decreased R&D productivity of pharmaceutical industry since the last
    decade.

  abstract: 'Given the importance of cross-disciplinary research (CDR), facilitating
    CDR effectiveness is a priority for many institutions and funding agencies. There
    are a number of CDR types, however, and the effectiveness of facilitation efforts
    will require sensitivity to that diversity. This article presents a method characterizing
    a spectrum of CDR designed to inform facilitation efforts that relies on bibliometric
    techniques and citation data. We illustrate its use by the Toolbox Project, an
    ongoing effort to enhance cross-disciplinary communication in CDR teams through
    structured, philosophical dialogue about research assumptions in a workshop setting.
    Toolbox Project workshops have been conducted with more than 85 research teams,
    but the project’s extensibility to an objectively characterized range of CDR collaborations
    has not been examined. To guide wider application of the Toolbox Project, we have
    developed a method that uses multivariate statistical analyses of transformed
    citation proportions from published manuscripts to identify candidate areas of
    CDR, and then overlays information from previous Toolbox participant groups on
    these areas to determine candidate areas for future application. The approach
    supplies 3 results of general interest: 1. A way to employ small data sets and
    familiar statistical techniques to characterize CDR spectra as a guide to scholarship
    on CDR patterns and trends. 2. A model for using bibliometric techniques to guide
    broadly applicable interventions similar to the Toolbox. 3. A method for identifying
    the location of collaborative CDR teams on a map of scientific activity, of use
    to research administrators, research teams, and other efforts to enhance CDR projects.'

  abstract: It is hoped that the knowledge produced by scientific research turns into
    concrete benefits (material or non-material). Bibliometrics, with its various
    indexes, became the reference of scientific evaluation as an “objective” measure
    of scientific impact. In Brazil, the evaluation system focused on CAPES has been
    of great importance for the development of postgraduate studies and research;
    however changes are necessary, among others, to its bibliometric approach. If
    we consider the area of health, the challenge of the Unified Health System (SUS)
    implies the search for scientifically sound alternatives, regarding questions
    ranging from diagnosis, cure and prevention of a variety of problems, to the organization
    of a macro-structure capable of giving broad and equal access to the resources
    required for improving the health of the population. The solutions require expertise
    and creativity on the part of the researchers and the expected products must include,
    but are not limited to scientific publications.

  abstract: Technology roadmapping offers a flexible instrument to portray development
    status in support of technology forecasting and assessment. This paper integrates
    bibliometrics with qualitative methodologies and visualisation techniques to construct
    a hybrid model for composing technology roadmaps. The mapping arrays details on
    the evolution of the technology under study and contributes to understanding the
    macro-technology development status. We generate a global technology roadmap for
    electric vehicles to demonstrate the approach in an empirical study.

  abstract: Scientific and engineering research is heavily dependent on effective
    development and use of software artifacts. Many of these artifacts are produced
    by the scientists themselves, rather than by trained software engineers. To address
    the challenges in this area, a research community often referred to as “Development
    of Scientific Software” has emerged in the last few decades. As this research
    area has matured, there has been a sharp increase in the number of papers and
    results made available, and it has thus become important to summarize and provide
    an overview about those studies. Through a systematic mapping and bibliometrics
    study, we have reviewed 130 papers in this area. We present the results of our
    study in this paper. Also we have made the mapping data available on an online
    repository which is planned to be updated on a regular basis. The results of our
    study seem to suggest that many software engineering techniques and activities
    are being used in the development of scientific software. However, there is still
    a need for further exploration of the usefulness of specific software engineering
    techniques (e.g., regarding software maintenance, evolution, refactoring, re(v)-engineering,
    process and project management) in the scientific context. It is hoped that this
    article will help (new) researchers get an overview of the research space and
    help them to understand the trends in the area.

  abstract: National Research Assessment Exercises (NRAEs) aim to improve returns
    from public funding of research. Critics argue that they undervalue publications
    influencing practice, not citations, implying that journals valued least by NRAEs
    are disproportionately useful to practitioners. Conservation biology can evaluate
    this criticism because it uses species recovery plans, which are practitioner-authored
    blueprints for recovering threatened species. The literature cited in them indicates
    what is important to practitioners’ work. We profiled journals cited in 50 randomly
    selected recovery plans from each of the USA, Australia and New Zealand, using
    ranking criteria from the Australian Research Council and the SCImago Institute.
    Citations showed no consistent pattern. Sometimes higher ranked publications were
    represented more frequently, sometimes lower ranked publications. Recovery plans
    in all countries also contained 37 % or more citations to ‘grey literature’, discounted
    in NRAEs. If NRAEs discourage peer-reviewed publication at any level they could
    exacerbate the trend not to publish information useful for applied conservation,
    possibly harming conservation efforts. While indicating the potential for an impact
    does not establish that it occurs, it does suggest preventive steps. NRAEs considering
    the proportion of papers in top journals may discourage publication in lower-ranked
    journals, because one way to increase the proportion of outputs in top journals
    is by not publishing in lower ones. Instead, perhaps only a user-nominated subset
    of publications could be evaluated, a department’s or an individual’s share of
    the top publications in a field could be noted, or innovative new multivariate
    assessments of research productivity applied, including social impact.

  abstract: Background. The h-index is used as an objective measure of research impact.
    Its validity, however, is not known in the context of general surgery and comparisons
    with other bibliometric indices are lacking. We sought to evaluate the h-index
    as a reliable and valid measure of research performance in general surgery across
    6 universities in the province of Ontario, Canada. Methods. Bibliometric indices
    for 219 faculty members in general surgery were calculated using the Scopus and
    Web of Science online databases. We investigated agreement between the databases.
    A 2-way analysis of variance was used to compare the h-index of surgeons grouped
    by institutional affiliation and academic rank and to identify the relative impact
    of these factors on different bibliometric indices. Results. The agreement on
    h-indices between the Scopus and Web of Science was problematic. The h-index was
    associated more strongly with academic rank (academic rank accounted for 33.3%
    of researcher’s h-index) than of the number of publications (12.5%) or the number
    of citations per author (10.2%). The number of citations per paper was not associated
    with academic rank. The institutional affiliation affected bibliometric indices
    to a similar degree to academic rank. Conclusion. Our data suggest better construct
    validity for the h-index than for other bibliometrics, although the agreement
    of h-index values between databases can be problematic for some researchers. The
    use of the h-index as a criterion-based assessment across different universities
    is problematic and that it should be used as a normative assessment tool, with
    comparisons with a specified population of interest. (Surgery 2013;153:493-501.).

  abstract: According to current research in bibliometrics, percentiles (or percentile
    rank classes) are the most suitable method for normalizing the citation counts
    of individual publications in terms of the subject area, the document type, and
    the publication year. Up to now, bibliometric research has concerned itself primarily
    with the calculation of percentiles. This study suggests how percentiles (and
    percentile rank classes) can be analyzed meaningfully for an evaluation study.
    Publication sets from four universities are compared with each other to provide
    sample data. These suggestions take into account on the one hand the distribution
    of percentiles over the publications in the sets (universities here) and on the
    other hand concentrate on the range of publications with the highest citation
    impactthat is, the range that is usually of most interest in the evaluation of
    scientific performance.

  abstract: 'This paper investigates the fitness-for-purpose and soundness of bibliometric
    parameters for measuring and elucidating the research performance of individual
    researchers in the field of education sciences in Switzerland. In order to take
    into account the specificities of publication practices of researchers in education
    sciences, the analyses are based on two separate databases: Web of Science and
    Google Scholar. Both databases show a very unequal distribution of the individual
    research output, and the indicators used to measure research performance (quantity
    of publications and citation impact) from the two data sources are highly positively
    correlated. However, individual characteristics of the researchers, such as age,
    gender and academic position, that serve to explain the great variance in research
    performance, can only be identified if the Web of Science is used as a benchmark
    of research performance. The results indicate that Google Scholar is so inclusive
    that it impedes a meaningful interpretation of the data. However, the Web of Science
    inclusion policy for journals is also associated with certain shortcomings that
    put some researchers at an unjustified disadvantage. Therefore, problems currently
    exist in regard to both citation databases when used to benchmark individual research
    performance.'

  abstract: Evaluative bibliometrics is concerned with comparing research units by
    using statistical procedures. According to Williams (2012) an empirical study
    should be concerned with the substantive and practical significance of the findings
    as well as the sign and statistical significance of effects. In this study we
    will explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are and how useful
    they are for institutional evaluative bibliometrics. As an illustration, we will
    calculate a regression model using publications (and citation data) produced by
    four universities in German-speaking countries from 1980 to 2010. We will show
    how these predictions and effects can be estimated and plotted, and how this makes
    it far easier to get a practical feel for the substantive meaning of results in
    evaluative bibliometric studies. An added benefit of this approach is that it
    makes it far easier to explain results obtained via sophisticated statistical
    techniques to a broader and sometimes non-technical audience. We will focus particularly
    on Average Adjusted Predictions (AAPs), Average Marginal Effects (AMEs), Adjusted
    Predictions at Representative Values (APRVs) and Marginal Effects at Representative
    Values (MERVs). (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

    analysis for a fieldspecific citation impact measurement. The times cited approach
    counts the citations of a given publication set. In contrast, we change the perspective
    and start by selecting all papers dealing with a specific research topic or field
    (the example in this study is research on Aspirin). Then we extract all cited
    references from the papers of this field-specific publication set and analyse
    which papers, scientists, and journals have been cited most often. In this study,
    we use the Chemical Abstracts registry number to select the publications for a
    specific field. However, the cited reference approach can be used with any other
    field classification system proposed up to now. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract: Counting compounds (rather than papers or citations) offers a new perspective
    for quantitative analyses of research activities. First of all, we can precisely
    define (compound-related) research topics and access the corresponding publications
    (scientific papers as well as patents) as a measure of research activity. We can
    also establish the time evolution of the publications dealing with specific compounds
    or compound classes. Moreover, the mapping of compounds by establishing compound-based
    landscapes has some potential to visualize the compound basis of research topics
    for further research activities. We have analyzed the rare earth compounds to
    give an example of a broad compound class. We present the number of the currently
    existing compounds and of the corresponding publications as well as the time evolution
    of the papers and patents. Furthermore, we have analyzed the rare earth cuprates
    (copper oxides) as an example of a narrower compound class to demonstrate the
    potential of mapping compounds by compound-based landscapes. We have quantified
    the various element combinations of the existing compounds and revealed all element
    combinations not yet realized in the synthesis within this compound class. Finally,
    we have analyzed the quasicrystal compound category as an example of a compound
    class that is not defined by a specific element combination or a molecular structure.

    scientometrics for many years, uniformity in the conduct of bibliometric analyses
    has not yet been achieved. The numerous dos and don’ts that exist in the field
    represent the implicit knowledge of experienced users, rather than a clearly defined
    set of rules and operating procedures. Our chapter seeks to establish standards
    for applying bibliometrics to the evaluation of research institutes in a number
    of areas in the natural sciences. These standards refer to the selection of the
    underlying data from the reference databases, the statistical analysis of the
    data and the presentation of results. We draw upon anonymized data from six research
    institutes active in similar research areas to illustrate the applicability of
    our proposed standards.

    the scientific relevance of a research article, in a particular research field,

  abstract: 'Over the last decades there has been a growing interest on developing
    research and formulating public policy by using the Innovation Systems approach.
    However, as evidenced on the academic literature there is a lack of systematic,
    chronological and synthesizing studies indicating how this field has evolved over
    time. This paper has as main objective to consolidate the state of the art of
    academic research on IS, based on a bibliometrics study on literature published
    over the past 35 years. The results are discussed under the following perspectives:
    general results, chronological distribution, author relevance, articles and cited
    references of relevance, journals relevance and institutions and countries relevance.
    The paper ends with a discussion of the main implications and limitations of the
    study.'

  abstract: Google Scholar, the academic bibliographic database provided free-of-charge
    by the search engine giant Google, has been suggested as an alternative or complementary
    resource to the commercial citation databases like Web of Knowledge (ISI/Thomson)
    or Scopus (Elsevier). In order to check the usefulness of this database for bibliometric
    analysis, and especially research evaluation, a novel approach is introduced.
    Instead of names of authors or institutions, a webometric analysis of academic
    web domains is performed. The bibliographic records for 225 top level web domains
    (TLD), 19,240 university and 6,380 research centres institutional web domains
    have been collected from the Google Scholar database. About 63.8% of the records
    are hosted in generic domains like .com or .org, confirming that most of the Scholar
    data come from large commercial or non-profit sources. Considering only institutions
    with at least one record, one-third of the other items (10.6% from the global)
    are hosted by the 10,442 universities, while 3,901 research centres amount for
    an additional 7.9% from the total. The individual analysis show that universities
    from China, Brazil, Spain, Taiwan or Indonesia are far better ranked than expected.
    In some cases, large international or national databases, or repositories are
    responsible for the high numbers found. However, in many others, the local contents,
    including papers in low impact journals, popular scientific literature, and unpublished
    reports or teaching supporting materials are clearly overrepresented. Google Scholar
    lacks the quality control needed for its use as a bibliometric tool; the larger
    coverage it provides consists in some cases of items not comparable with those
    provided by other similar databases.

  abstract: 'Objectives. - Analyze the results of the bibliometric system and analysis
    of scientific publications (SIGAPS) in the Assistance publique-Hopitaux de Paris
    (AP-HP) and compare the scientific production among the various surgical disciplines
    of the academic hospitals of Paris and define the place of urology. Methods. -
    The publications from 115 surgical departments between 2006 and 2008 were included.
    Only surgical departments were considered in the current study. The following
    data were taken into account: the hospital department of origin, the number of
    articles published, the number of first place, last places, the number of full-time
    unit, the SIGAPS score. Statistical analysis focused on the quality and on the
    quantity of published articles per surgeons and per department. There were eight
    academic departments of urology identified within the AP-HP. Results. - The database
    contained information for 115 surgical departments. The mean number of articles
    published by department was 42.89 +/- 27.34 (13.2 to 110.75). The mean number
    of publications per full-time surgeon was 6.7 +/- 2.59 (3.77 to 12.84), or a mean
    of 2.25 +/- 0.86 released by full-time and by year. The median score SIGAPS of
    surgery was 304 with a wide interval (122 to 903.5). Urology was the specialty
    with the highest median score compared to other surgical specialties. The department,
    which published the most, was the center 1, in comparison with the center 6 which
    was publishing the most in A/B ranking journals. Conclusion. - Urology was the
    absolute leader by far in terms of scientific publications in the AP-HP when compared
    to other surgical disciplines. The discipline is organized efficiently to juggle
    clinical work and research indicating a certain dynamism of the teams that invest
    there to fulfill the missions assigned to them in the University Hospital and
    the part of the autonomy of the universities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

  abstract: Many discussions have enlarged the literature in Bibliometrics since the
    Hirsch proposal, the so called h-index. Ranking papers according to their citations,
    this index quantifies a researcher only by its greatest possible number of papers
    that are cited at least h times. A closed formula for h-index distribution that
    can be applied for distinct databases is not yet known. In fact, to obtain such
    distribution, the knowledge of citation distribution of the authors and its specificities
    are required. Instead of dealing with researchers randomly chosen, here we address
    different groups based on distinct databases. The first group is composed of physicists
    and biologists, with data extracted from Institute of Scientific Information (IS!).
    The second group is composed of computer scientists, in which data were extracted
    from Google-Scholar system. In this paper, we obtain a general formula for the
    h-index probability density function (pdf) for groups of authors by using generalized
    exponentials in the context of escort probability. Our analysis includes the use
    of several statistical methods to estimate the necessary parameters. Also an exhaustive
    comparison among the possible candidate distributions are used to describe the
    way the citations are distributed among authors. The h-index pdf should be used
    to classify groups of researchers from a quantitative point of view, which is
    meaningfully interesting to eliminate obscure qualitative methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier

  abstract: Citations to published work are gaining increasing prominence in evaluations
    of the research performance of scientists. Considering the importance accorded
    to gender issues in South African science, it is surprising that (to our knowledge)
    no research has as yet ascertained the extent of sex differences in citations
    to the published work of scientists in this country. Our literature study shows
    that studies that have been conducted elsewhere tend to neglect in their analyses
    important gender-related and other factors, such as the sex composition of multi-authored
    papers and the extent of foreign co-authorship. Against this background, we illustrate
    the difficulties inherent in measuring the quality aspect of sex-specific research
    performance by means of an analysis of a dataset of articles (n = 229) that were
    published between 1990 and 2002 in the field of invasion ecology and in journals
    included in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science. Each article has at least one
    South African author address. The results indicate that foreign co-authorship
    is a better correlate of high citations than the sex of South African authors,
    and this is true irrespective of whether the annual citation rate or window period
    is used, whether or not self-citations are excluded, and whether or not the number
    of authors is controlled for by calculating fractional counts. The paper highlights
    these and other considerations that are relevant for future gender-focused bibliometric
    research, both in South Africa and beyond.

    national research assessment exercises, as far as the hard sciences are concerned.
    In this work we compare rankings lists of universities captured by the first Italian
    evaluation exercise, through peer review, with the results of bibliometric simulations.
    The comparison shows the great differences between peer review and bibliometric
    rankings for excellence and productivity.

  abstract: 'Objective: The h-index allows the evaluation of scholarly output in academics,
    but this bibliometric statistic has not been applied extensively to measure productivity
    in anesthesiology. The authors tested the hypothesis that the h-index is dependent
    on academic rank, American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation
    of the training program, and National Board of Echocardiography credentials in
    perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in United States academic
    cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. Design: Observational. Setting: Internet analysis.
    Participants: United States academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. Interventions:
    None. Measurements and Main Results: Faculty members from 30 randomly selected
    fellowship programs with or without accreditation were identified using the Society
    of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists web site. The status of each faculty member’s
    credentials in perioperative TEE was defined using the “verify certification”
    function on the National Board of Echocardiography web site. Publications, citations,
    citations/publication, and the h-index for each faculty member were obtained using
    Scopus. Two hundred fifty-nine cardiothoracic anesthesiologists (204 men and 55
    women) were identified (8 instructors \[3%\], 123 assistant professors \[48%\],
    56 associate professors \[22%\], 63 professors \[24%\], and 9 chairpersons \[3%\]).
    The average cardiothoracic anesthesiologist had an h-index of 6 +/- 7 with 28
    +/- 46 publications, 499 +/- 988 total citations, and 13 +/- 18 citations per
    publication. The h-index increased significantly (p \< 0.05) among ranks (instructors
    \[1 +/- 1\], assistant professors \[3 +/- 3\], associate professors \[7 +/- 5\],
    professors \[12 +/- 8\], and chairpersons \[18 +/- 13\]). Significant differences
    in the number of publications and total citations also were observed among ranks.
    Differences in the h-index among ranks were observed regardless of program accreditation
    status or transesophageal echocardiographic credentials. Faculty members working
    in American College of Graduate Medical Education accredited programs had more
    publications and citations and higher h-indices than their counterparts in programs
    that were not accredited. Except for program directors, the scholarly output of
    academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists with or without transesophageal echocardiographic
    credentials was similar within each academic rank. Conclusions: The results show
    that the h-index increases progressively with academic rank and is dependent on
    fellowship program accreditation status but not transesophageal echocardiographic
    credentials in United States academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. (C) 2011

  abstract: The h-index is used to evaluate scholarly productivity in academic medicine,
    but has not been extensively used in anaesthesia. We analysed the publications,
    citations, citations per publication and h-index from 1996 to date using the Scopus
    (R) database for 1630 (1120 men, 510 women) for faculty members from 24 randomly
    selected US academic anaesthesiology departments The median (interquartile range
    \[range\]) h-index of US academic anaesthesiologists was 1 \[0-5 (0-44)\] with
    3 \[0-18 (0-398)\] total publications, 24 \[0-187 (0-8515)\] total citations,
    and 5 \[0-14 (0-252)\] citations per publication. Faculty members in departments
    with National Institutes of Health funding were more productive than colleagues
    in departments with little or no government funding. The h-index increased significantly
    between successive academic ranks concomitant with increases in the number of
    publications and total citations. Men had higher median h-index than women concomitant
    with more publications and citations, but the number of citations per publication
    was similar between groups. Our results suggest that h-index is a reasonable indicator
    of scholarly productivity in anaesthesia. The results may help comparisons of
    academic productivity across countries and may be used to assess whether new initiatives
    designed to reverse recent declines in academic anaesthetic are working.

  abstract: 'Background. Bibliometrics provide surrogate measures of the quality and
    quantity of research undertaken by departments and individuals. Previous reports
    have suggested that academic anaesthesia research in the UK is in decline. We
    wished to provide a comprehensive description of current and historical published
    output of UK anaesthesia researchers. Methods. Bibliometric indices (Web of Science
    (R)) were calculated for anaesthesia researchers in the UK for the whole period
    covered by the database, and for 2004-8. A parallel search was made using the
    Scholarometer (TM) tool, which parses output from Google Scholar (TM). Calculated
    indices included total number of publications; total number of citations; citations
    per paper; h-index; g-index; and modified impact index. Results. One hundred and
    four individuals and 23 academic departments were identified. Median values (inter-quartile
    range) for the indices were: total papers 57 (24-95) (individuals for the whole
    period), 11 (6-20) (individuals 2004-8), 50 (30-70) (departments 2004-8); total
    number of citations 571 (175-1328), 93 (38-207), 383 (239-845); h-index 13 (8-20),
    6 (3-8), 11 (9-14). Four departments were ranked in the top 5 for all indices.
    Conclusions. The general distribution of bibliometric data is similar to that
    seen in other specialities in Europe and North America. Four departments contribute
    to more than 50% of published anaesthesia research output in this data set. These
    data provide useful comparative tools for individuals, departments, and national
    bodies.'

  abstract: Quantitative analysis of publications and their citations, a procedure
    known as bibliometries, has become increasingly important in the evaluation of
    scientists and clinicians. In the clinical setting, bibliometrics is used for
    the calculation of hospital budgets. While bibliometrics is attractive because
    it rapidly provides numbers that bear a certain relation to scientific productivity,
    it is often misused. The parameters chosen are questionable and sometimes worthless
    because of material errors or inappropriate use. More importantly, reducing the
    activity of a scientist or physician simply to the number of his or her publications
    or citations, without analyzing the importance and impact of the work itself can
    lead to serious errors.

  abstract: 'National research assessment exercises are becoming regular events in
    ever more countries. The present work contrasts the peer-review and bibliometrics
    approaches in the conduct of these exercises. The comparison is conducted in terms
    of the essential parameters of any measurement system: accuracy, robustness, validity,
    functionality, time and costs. Empirical evidence shows that for the natural and
    formal sciences, the bibliometric methodology is by far preferable to peer-review.
    Setting up national databases of publications by individual authors, derived from
    Web of Science or Scopus databases, would allow much better, cheaper and more
    frequent national research assessments.'

    show so little curiosity about the context within which information is produced
    and used? Why do they neglect this opportunity to demonstrate the importance of
    information to development? What more do teachers need to communicate about the
    purpose of bibliometrics and how to apply them in an influential way?

  abstract: This study explores the entire archive of RAE-eletronica, consisting of
    240 articles in 18 editions, from 2002 to 2010, using techniques of bibliometrics,
    social network analysis and geographic analysis. It analyzes the content, involving
    titles, keywords, summary and body of texts; collaboration between authors and
    institutions; most influential journals and conferences, and citations and self-citations
    involving authorship and references. It concludes that the RAE-eletronica collection
    largely reflects the characteristics of the universe of recent academic administration
    production in Brazil, due to the greater influence of RAE and international journals,
    and Anpad conferences. Highlights are FGV-EAESP, USP and UFRGS as the most influential
    institutions of the collection. Terms like “company”, “organization” and “work”
    are among the most mentioned in the texts, while “management” is the most frequent
    keyword. The combined use of the techniques explored in this article leverages
    its appropriation to other sets of articles and scientific fields.

  abstract: Recent literature on issues relevant to bibliometric indicator relations
    and peer review discusses whether bibliometric indicators can predict the success
    of research grant applications. For example, Van den Besselaar and Leydesdorff
    (2009) reported a higher average number of publications/citations for the group
    of approved applicants than for the rejected applicants (section Social and Behavioral
    Sciences of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research \[NOW\], MaGW).
    However, this difference disappears or even reverses when the group of 275 successful
    applicants was compared only to the best 275 rejected applicants. Given these
    findings, we have continued our analyses of publication data of applicants for
    the Emmy Noether-Programme (ENP) provided by the German Research Foundation. First,
    we compared the group of actual ENP applicants to a sample of potential applicants,
    which revealed a ‘lack of low performers’ among the actual ENP applicants. Furthermore,
    we conducted discriminant analyses to predict funding decisions on the basis of
    several bibliometric indicators.

    “mutations” is demonstrated by a few typical examples. Complex author names, complicated
    journal names, and other sources of errors that result from prior citation practice
    are further issues. Finally, some basic phenomena limiting the meaning of citation
    counts of historical papers are presented and explained.'

  abstract: Academic nurses are increasingly turning to bibliometrics to assess the
    state and status of research publication in nursing in countries around the world.
    Early bibliometric studies were carried out by Cattell as part of a project to
    advance research in psychology in the early decades of the 20th century. There
    are some echoes in nursing’s moves to increase its standing over the last 40 years.
    The interpretation of bibliometric studies can reveal embedded values about academic
    disciplinary activity and normative views of scientific work. Patterns of publishing
    by nurse academics appear increasingly to resemble those in biomedicine as a whole.

  abstract: National exercises for the evaluation of research activity by universities
    are becoming regular practice in ever more countries. These exercises have mainly
    been conducted through the application of peer-review methods. Bibliometrics has
    not been able to offer a valid large-scale alternative because of almost overwhelming
    difficulties in identifying the true author of each publication. We will address
    this problem by presenting a heuristic approach to author name disambiguation
    in bibliometric datasets for large-scale research assessments. The application
    proposed concerns the Italian university system, comprising 80 universities and
    a research staff of over 60,000 scientists. The key advantage of the proposed
    approach is the ease of implementation. The algorithms are of practical application
    and have considerably better scalability and expandability properties than state-of-the-art
    unsupervised approaches. Moreover, the performance in terms of precision and recall,
    which can be further improved, seems thoroughly adequate for the typical needs
    of large-scale bibliometric research assessments.

  abstract: The trend to use administrative health care databases as research material
    is increasing but not well explored. Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research
    Database (NHIRD), one of the largest administrative health care databases around
    the world, has been used widely in academic studies. This study analyzed 383 NHIRD
    studies published between 2000 and 2009 to quantify the effects on overall growth,
    scholar response, and spread of the study fields. The NHIRD studies expanded rapidly
    in both quantity and quality since the first study was published in 2000. Researchers
    usually collaborated to share knowledge, which was crucial to process the NHIRD
    data. However, once the fundamental problem had been overcome, success to get
    published became more reproducible. NHIRD studies were also published diversely
    in a growing number of journals. Both general health and clinical science studies
    benefited from NIIIRD. In conclusion, this new research material widely promotes
    scientific production in a greater magnitude. The experience of Taiwan’s NHIRD
    should encourage national- or institutional-level data holders to consider re-using
    their administrative databases for academic purposes.

  abstract: This issue, inspired by the extensive scientific oeuvre of Anthony van
    Raan, provides a concise tour de horizon of current research evaluation topics
    and quantitative studies of science. A historiograph analysis positions key documents,
    written by Van Raan and other authors, that helped define the present-day field
    of bibliometrics. A life-cycle output analysis traces phases in the development
    of CWTS, Anthony’s institute at Leiden University. Other contributions in this
    issue focus on the long-term importance of a paper’s references as exemplified
    by landmark scholarly texts and the phenomenon of ‘Sleeping Beauties’. Several
    papers focus on how the autonomy of institutes and researchers is related to bibliometric
    research evaluation. High-quality S&T indicators can act as structuring devises
    in policy debate and collective learning processes. We also learn about the need
    for statistical tests to distinguish among researchers with a similar h-index.

  abstract: The UCV is a major player within the Sistema. Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia
    e Innovacion (National System of Science. Technology and Innovation) in Venezuela.
    This paper aims to establish the historical weight that this institution represents
    regarding its production of scientific publications as registered in the Web of
    Science (WoS), relative to the whole country. The WoS was queried by using the
    term “Venezuela” as “Country of Origin for the Publication” in order to generate
    a database, which in turn was used as the source for the current study and for
    a time frame ranging from 1981 to 2007. Entries corresponding to Health and Quality
    of Life were segmented based on the UNESCO taxonomy using a functionality offered
    by the software BIBLIOS. These findings show the importance that research developed
    by the UCV in these fields of knowledge has for Venezuelan society.

  abstract: 'The publications in scientometrics and bibliometrics with Brazilian authorship
    expanded exponentially in the 1990-2006 period, reaching 13 times in the Web of
    Science database and 19.5 times in the Google Scholar database. This increase
    is rather superior to that of the total Brazilian scientific production in the
    same time period (5.6 times in the Web of Science). Some characteristics to be
    noticed in this rise are: 1) The total number of articles during this period was
    197; in that, 78% were published in 57 Brazilian journals and 22% in 13 international
    journals. 2) The national and international articles averaged 4.3 and 5.9 citations/article,
    respectively; two journals stood out among these, the national Ciencia da Informacao
    (44 articles averaging 6.7 citations/article) and the international Scientometrics
    (32 articles averaging 6.2 citations/article). 3) The articles encompass an impressive
    participation of authors from areas other than information science; only one-fourth
    of the authors are bound to the information science field, the remaining ones
    being distributed among the areas of humanities/business administration, biology/biomedicine,
    health and hard sciences. The occurrence of adventitious authors at this level
    of multidisciplinarity is uncommon in science. However, the possible benefits
    of such patterns are not clear in view of a fragmented intercommunication among
    the authors, as noticed through the citations. The advantages of changing this
    trend and of using other scientometric and bibliometric databases, such as SciELO,
    to avoid an almost exclusive use of the Web of Science database, are discussed.'

  abstract: 'We propose a new hybrid clustering framework to incorporate text mining
    with bibliometrics in journal set analysis. The framework integrates two different
    approaches: clustering ensemble and kernel-fusion clustering. To improve the flexibility
    and the efficiency of processing large-scale data, we propose an information-based
    weighting scheme to leverage the effect of multiple data sources in hybrid clustering.
    Three different algorithms are extended by the proposed weighting scheme and they
    are employed on a large journal set retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database.
    The clustering performance of the proposed algorithms is systematically evaluated
    using multiple evaluation methods, and they were cross-compared with alternative
    methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed weighted hybrid clustering
    strategy is superior to other methods in clustering performance and efficiency.
    The proposed approach also provides a more refined structural mapping of journal
    sets, which is useful for monitoring and detecting new trends in different scientific
    fields.'

  abstract: In this study an attempt is made to establish new bibliometric indicators
    for the assessment of research in the Humanities. Data from a Dutch Faculty of
    Humanities was used to provide the investigation a sound empirical basis. For
    several reasons (particularly related to coverage) the standard citation indicators,
    developed for the sciences, are unsatisfactory. Target expanded citation analysis
    and the use of oeuvre (lifetime) citation data, as well as the addition of library
    holdings and productivity indicators enable a more representative and fair assessment.
    Given the skew distribution of population data, individual rankings can best be
    determined based on log transformed data. For group rankings this is less urgent
    because of the central limit theorem. Lifetime citation data is corrected for
    professional age by means of exponential regression.

  abstract: 'As bibliometric indicators are objective, reliable, and cost-effective
    measures of peer-reviewed research outputs, they are expected to play an increasingly
    important role in research assessment/management. Recently, a bibliometric approach
    was developed and integrated within the evaluation framework of research funded
    by the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC). This approach helped address
    the following questions that were difficult to answer objectively using alternative
    methods such as program documentation review and key informant interviews: (a)
    Has the NCIC peer-review process selected outstanding Canadian scientists in cancer
    research? (b) Have the NCIC grants contributed to increasing the scientific performance
    of supported researchers? (c) How do the NCIC-supported researchers compare to
    their neighbors supported by the U. S. National Cancer Institute? Using the NCIC
    evaluation as a case study, this article demonstrates the usefulness of bibliometrics
    to address key evaluation questions and discusses its integration, along complementary
    indicators (e. g., peer ratings), in a practice-driven research evaluation continuum.'

  abstract: Since the publication of Robert K. Merton’s theory of cumulative advantage
    in science (Matthew Effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its
    presence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions, or countries.
    However, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic “quality” of papers or
    of researchers-”better” (however defined) papers or researchers could receive
    higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. Using an original
    method for controlling the intrinsic value of papers-identical duplicate papers
    published in different journals with different impact factors-this paper shows
    that the journal in which papers are published have a strong influence on their
    citation rates, as duplicate papers published in high-impact journals obtain,
    on average, twice as many citations as their identical counterparts published
    in journals with lower impact factors. The intrinsic value of a paper is thus
    not the only reason a given paper gets cited or not, there is a specific Matthew
    Effect attached to journals and this gives to papers published there an added
    value over and above their intrinsic quality.

    begins by criticizing article counts used in other venues. It concludes by demonstrating
    that the problem of decline is not merely in relative shares between countries,
    but also an absolute decline in American-authored articles across the board. We
    close with some proposed causes of the decline.'

  abstract: The allocation of resources for research is increasingly based on so-called
    ‘bibliometrics’. Scientists are now deemed to be successful on the sole condition
    that their work be abundantly cited. This world-wide trend appears to enjoy support
    not only by granting agencies (whose task is obviously simplified by extensive
    recourse to bibliometrics), but also by the scientists themselves (who seem to
    enjoy their status of celebrities). This trend appears to be fraught with dangers,
    particularly in the area of social sciences, where bibliometrics are less developed,
    and where monographs (which are not taken into account in citation indexes) are
    often more important than articles published in journals. We argue in favour of
    a return to the values of ‘real science’, in analogy to the much-promised return
    to a ‘real economy’. While economists may strive towards a more objective evaluation
    of the prospects of a company, a market, or an industrial sector, we scientists
    can only base our appraisal on a responsible practice of peer review. Since we
    fear that decision-takers of granting agencies such as the FNRS, CTI, EPFL, ETHZ,
    ANR, CNRS, NIH, NSF, DOE,(\[1\]) etc. will be too busy to read our humble paper
    in Chimia, we appeal to scientists of all countries and disciplines to unite against
    the tyranny of bibliometrics.

  abstract: Bibliometric methods may be used to study the impact of a field, the impact
    of certain trends and researchers within that field, and of course the impact
    of particular research articles. This is no different for the field of lexicography,
    and the output of both metalexicographers and dictionary makers alike is increasingly
    being measured and quantified. Analysing such data enables one (a) to track the
    growing and waning popularity of certain lexicographic sub-fields, (b) to pinpoint
    the new directions heralded by specific lexicographic papers or by new types of
    dictionaries, and (c) to map the lexicographic schools of thought that have formed
    around some of the pioneering or most productive scholars. In this article, bibliometrics
    in lexicography are investigated by taking the International Journal of Lexicography
    as the centre piece. In the first half of the article, various bibliometric tools
    relevant to lexicography are introduced, and in the second half these tools are
    used to show that lexicography has truly become an independent discipline. In
    the process, comparisons are also made with two other lexicographic journals (Dictionaries
    and Lexikos), as well as with two journals from other disciplines (Linguistics
    and Applied Linguistics).

  abstract: 'Despite the increasing number and diversity of publications related to
    soil erosion in Brazil and throughout the world, the central questions of this
    science remain unanswered. The possible reasons for this imbalance highlight the
    need to reconsider the role of research on soil erosion. Bibliometric studies
    can provide ample view of the research field, describing perspectives, but research
    using this approach is scarce in international as well as in Brazilian literature.
    The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial, temporal, institutional
    and topical distribution of Brazilian research on accelerated soil erosion based
    on the organization of articles according to thematic lines and to discuss the
    depth of the approach to the fundamental issues of erosion in order to establish
    a bibliometric perspective. For this purpose, 225 articles of Brazilian institutions
    focused on soil erosion were scanned, registered in a database and classified
    into five thematic lines. Besides, multi-temporal maps were drawn using GIS tools.
    Brazilian research on erosion is recent and is characterized by: (a) concentration
    in few institutions in the southern and southeastern Brazil, (b) focused on two
    issues, related to the Universal Soil Loss Equation and comparisons of agricultural
    managements as related to soil loss, with a considerable influence of the consolidation
    level of the research centers, which have developed research on accelerated soil
    erosion along these two lines.'

    in a stage of consolidation because too little work has as yet been published.

    most suitable include demonstrated use and testing under real-time clinical conditions,
    scope of terms, cost, and the administrative infrastructure to sustain and evolve
    the terminology. Likelihood of survival is also critical and was evaluated here
    by examining the diffusion pattern of each terminology set through bibliometric

  abstract: 'Objectives : This study evaluates malaria vaccine research carried out
    in different parts of the world during 1972-2004 using different bibliometric
    indicators. Method : Data have been downloaded from PubMed for the period 1972-2004
    using the keywords (malaria\* or plasmodium or falciparum) and (vaccine\*) in
    the title and abstract fields. The study examined the pattern of growth of the
    output, its geographical distribution, profile of different countries in different
    subfields and pattern of citations using GOOGLE Scholar. Results : Malaria vaccine
    research output is gradually increasing. The USA, followed by the UK and Australia
    contributed the highest number of papers. Publication activity has decreased in
    Switzerland and Sweden, but has increased in Brazil and China. The majority of
    the countries have focused on the development of asexual blood stage malaria.
    Citations per paper and incidence of high-quality papers for the USA, the UK,
    Papua New Guinea and Denmark are more than the average. The majority of the prolific
    institutions are located in the USA, the UK, France and Australia. Conclusion
    : The last two decades have witnessed considerable growth in research output in
    this field, while a successful malaria vaccine still remains elusive. Interestingly,
    the countries like the USA, the UK and Australia that lead in the quantity, quality
    and citation of this output are often not those directly affected by malaria.'

  abstract: In 2006 the English Department of Health launched a programme with 450m
    pound for the funding of around 10 biomedical research centres over a five-year
    period, to be within leading clinical and university partnerships, able to demonstrate
    international excellence and reflect a range of clinical areas. The bespoke process
    to procure the biomedical research centres resulted in relatively low transaction
    costs, compared to more traditional routes into funding research centres, and
    is an example of the use of metrics that could inform the on-going debate in the
    UK regarding future research assessment exercises.

  abstract: Research assessment in the UK has evolved over a quarter of a century
    from a loosely structured, peer-review based process to one with a well understood
    data portfolio and assessment methodology. After 2008, the assessment process
    will shift again, to the use of indicators based largely on publication and citation
    data. These indicators will in part follow the format introduced in 2008, with
    a profiling of assessment outcomes at national and international levels. However,
    the shift from peer assessment to a quantitative methodology raises critical issues
    about which metrics are appropriate and informative and how such metrics should
    be managed to produce weighting factors for funding formulae. The link between
    publication metrics and other perceptions of research quality needs to be thoroughly
    tested and reviewed, and may be variable between disciplines. Many of the indicators
    that drop out of publication data are poorly linked to quality and should not
    be used at all. There are also issues about which publications are the correct
    base for assessment, which staff should be included in a review, how subjects
    should be structured and how the citation data should be normalised to account
    for discipline-dependent variables. Finally, it is vital to consider the effect
    that any assessment process will have on the behaviour of those to be assessed.

  abstract: The use of outcome control modes of research evaluation exercises is ever
    more frequent. They are conceived as tools to stimulate increased levels of research
    productivity, and to guide choices in allocating components of government research
    budgets for publicly funded institutions. There are several contributions in the
    literature that compare the different methodological approaches that policy makers
    could adopt for these exercises, however the comparisons are limited to only a
    few disciplines. This work, examining the case of the whole of the “hard sciences”
    of the Italian academic system, makes a comparison between results obtained from
    peer review type of evaluations (as adopted by the Ministry of Universities and
    Research) and those possible from a bibliometric approach (as developed by the
    authors). The aim is to understand to what extent bibliometric methodology, which
    is noted as relatively inexpensive, time-saving and exhaustive, can complement
    and integrate peer review methodology in research evaluation. (C) 2008 Elsevier

  abstract: Bibliometric analysis is an important tool in the management of a journal.
    SCOPUS Output is used to assess the increase in the quantity of material in Atmospheric
    Environment and stylistic changes in the way authors choose words and punctuation
    in titles and assemble their reference lists. Citation analysis is used to consider
    the impact factor of the journal, but perhaps more importantly the way in which
    it reflects the importance authors give to papers published in Atmospheric Environment.
    The impact factor of Atmospheric Environment (2.549 for 2007) from the journal
    Citation Reports Suggests it performs well within the atmospheric sciences, but
    it conceals the long term Value authors place on papers appearing in the journal.

  abstract: 'Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether publications
    of importance for improving the health system and its technologies are highly
    cited intrascientifically. Methods: Bibliometric assessment of the 596 publications
    used as sources in the fifty SBU Alerts from 2001 to 2004 from the Swedish Council
    on Technology Assessment in Health Care was carried out using the Thomson Scientific
    citation indexes. Normalized citation scores were calculated for all included
    studies. Additional factors such as the time and place of the research, subject
    categories, and journal source were analyzed. Results: On average, the sources
    in SBU Alert have been cited eight times more than the world average consistently
    during the time period and across research areas. Articles used as its scientific
    basis are often published in a few, high impact, general medical journals. However,
    many of the articles are published in field-specific journals with low impact
    factors. Most articles used in SBU Alert are published by authors based in the
    United States or the United Kingdom. However, Swedish, Danish, and Dutch publications
    are overrepresented in its science base, whereas Japanese, Taiwanese, Indian,
    and Russian publications are underrepresented. Conclusions: Publications used
    as sources in a Swedish system for identification and early assessment of new
    methods in health care are also highly cited within the scientific community.
    This finding increases the appropriateness of using bibliometric indicators in
    evaluations of clinical research and suggests that decision makers through SBU
    Alert are getting scientifically sound advice.'

  abstract: Bibliometric research has risen in popularity during recent years and
    an increasing number of investigations now have examined the nursing literature.
    Our article provides a comprehensive overview of citation-based research in the
    nursing profession, as well as a discussion of bibliometrics, journal impact factors,
    and international publishing trends. The debate on evidence-based practice and
    its potential influence and relevance for nursing scholars is also covered. Although
    journal performance indicators are, no doubt, important for the contemporary nursing
    academic, it is the core research skills and attributes that nursing scholars,
    academics, and educators will need to consider more carefully in future if the
    next generation of professional nurse researchers is to truly flourish.

  abstract: Soil science history studies are rare and the Brazilian scientific community
    has not given substantial attention to this subject yet. The present study focused
    on the formation of research on accelerated soil erosion in the Brazil from a
    bibliometric perspective. A comprehensive database of published scientific papers
    was organized in a relational database and analyzed by SQL queries and GIS tools.
    These data were used to calculate quantitative indicators and spatial distribution
    patterns. Results indicate a recent development of research on accelerated soil
    erosion in Brazil by few institutions and authors in the South and Southeast regions.
    Moreover, a thematic analysis indicated the agricultural perspective as the main
    focus of erosion studies, with a great emphasis on the USLE prediction model.

  abstract: Bibliometrics has changed out of all recognition since 1958; becoming
    established as a field, being taught widely in library and information science
    schools, and being at the core of a number of science evaluation research groups
    around the world. This was all made possible by the work of Eugene Garfield and
    his Science Citation Index. This article reviews the distance that bibliometrics
    has travelled since 1958 by comparing early bibliometrics with current practice,
    and by giving an overview of a range of recent developments, such as patent analysis,
    national research evaluation exercises, visualization techniques, new applications,
    online citation indexes, and the creation of digital libraries. Webometrics, a
    modern, fast- growing offshoot of bibliometrics, is reviewed in detail. Finally,
    future prospects are discussed with regard to both bibliometrics and webometrics.

  abstract: The use of bibliometrics indicators to study research activity is based
    on which the scientific publications are essential product of this activity, and
    provide information about the research process, its volume, evolution, visibility
    and structure. So, they allow to value the scientific activity, and influences
    (or impact) of the work and the sources. The bibliometrics studies, altogether
    with other indicators, allows an objective quantification of the knowledge, and
    are harnessed by the present explosion of the knowledge and its compilation in
    bibliographical data bases.

  abstract: Although the fields of bibliometrics and citation analysis have existed
    for many years, relatively few studies have specifically focused on the dermatological
    literature. This article reviews citation-based research in the dermatology journals,
    with a particular interest in manuscripts that have included Contact Dermatitis
    as part of their analysis. Overall, it can be seen that the rise of bibliometrics
    during the mid-20th century and its subsequent application to dermatology has
    provided an interesting insight into the progression of research within our discipline.
    Further investigation of citation trends and top-cited papers in skin research
    periodicals would certainly help complement the current body of knowledge.

  abstract: This study has as its objective to identify the scientific studies dealing
    with the orientation to patients submitted to ostomy published between 1970 to
    2004 and to classify them according to quantity, chronology of publication, authors’
    function, source, kind of study, topic, origin and key words by using the bibliometrics
    methodology. A total of 27 publications were collected in the DEDALUS databank,
    in the LILACS and MEDLINE databases and from a professor of the University of
    Sao Paulo’s Nursing School ( EEUSP, which is a national reference in ostomy in
    Brazil). Of these, 19 were written by Brazilians and 8 by non-Brazilians; most
    were written by nurses and enterostomal therapists. Dissertations, theses, orientation
    manuals, books and articles were found. The origin of the material was academia,
    laboratories and hospitals. The 1990s concentrated the largest number of studies
    in this thematic area. All of them have the purpose of elevating patients’ self-esteem
    in order to make them feel that, even with an ostomy, they can have a normal life.
    Thus the study concludes that the nurse, as an educator for the ostomy patient,
    should be acquainted with those publications to improve the assistance he/she
    provides.

  abstract: 'In Sperber and Wilson’s relevance theory (RT), the ratio Cognitive Effects/Processing
    Effort defines the relevance of a communication. The tf\*idf formula from information
    retrieval is used to operationalize this ratio for any item co-occurring with
    a user-supplied seed term in bibliometric distributions. The tf weight of the
    item predicts its effect on the user in the context of the seed term, and its
    idf weight predicts the user’s processing effort in relating the item to the seed
    term. The idf measure, also known as statistical specificity, is shown to have
    unsuspected applications in quantifying interrelated concepts such as topical
    and nontopical relevance, levels of user expertise, and levels of authority. A
    new kind of visualization, the pennant diagram, illustrates these claims. The
    bibliometric distributions visualized are the works cocited with a seed work (Moby
    Dick), the authors cocited with a seed author (White HD, for maximum interpretability),
    and the books and articles cocited with a seed article (S.A. Harter’s “Psychological
    Relevance and Information Science,” which introduced RT to information scientists
    in 1992). Pennant diagrams use bibliometric data and information retrieval techniques
    on the system side to mimic a relevance-theoretic model of cognition on the user
    side. Relevance theory may thus influence the design of new visual information
    retrieval interfaces. Generally, when information retrieval and bibliometrics
    are interpreted in light of RT, the implications are rich: A single sociocognitive
    theory may serve to integrate research on literature-based systems with research
    on their users, areas now largely separate.'

  abstract: When bibliometric data are converted to term frequency (tf) and inverse
    document frequency (idf) values, plotted as pennant diagrams, and interpreted
    according to Sperber and Wilson’s relevance theory (RT), the results evoke major
    variables of information science (IS). These include topicality, in the sense
    of intercohesion and intercoherence among texts; cognitive effects of texts in
    response to people’s questions; people’s levels of expertise as a precondition
    for cognitive effects; processing effort as textual or other messages are received;
    specificity of terms as it affects processing effort; relevance, defined in RT
    as the effects/effort ratio; and authority of texts and their authors. While such
    concerns figure automatically in dialogues between people, they become problematic
    when people create or use or judge literature-based information systems. The difficulty
    of achieving worthwhile cognitive effects and acceptable processing effort in
    human-system dialogues explains why relevance is the central concern of IS. Moreover,
    since relevant communication with both systems and unfamiliar people is uncertain,
    speakers tend to seek cognitive effects that cost them the least effort. Yet hearers
    need greater effort, often greater specificity, from speakers if their responses
    are to be highly relevant in their turn. This theme of mismatch manifests itself
    in vague reference questions, underdeveloped online searches, uncreative judging
    in retrieval evaluation trials, and perfunctory indexing. Another effect of least
    effort is a bias toward topical relevance over other kinds. RT can explain these
    outcomes as well as more adaptive ones. Pennant diagrams, applied here to a literature
    search and a Bradford-style journal analysis, can model them. Given RT and the
    right context, bibliometrics may predict psychometrics.

  abstract: It is rather difficult to forecast emerging technologies as there is no
    historical data available. In such cases, the use of bibliometrics and patent
    analysis have provided useful data. This paper presents the forecasts for three
    emerging technology areas by integrating the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis
    into well-known technology forecasting tools such as scenario planning, growth
    curves and analogies. System dynamics is also used to be able to model the dynamic
    ecosystem of the technologies and their diffusion. Technologies being forecasted
    are fuel cell, food safety and optical storage technologies. Results from these
    three applications help us to validate the proposed methods as appropriate tools
    to forecast emerging technologies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  abstract: Among the many statistics on science, called scientometrics, bibliometrics
    holds a privileged place. Bibliometrics is one of the few subfields concerned
    with measuring the output side of science. According to most “histories”, bibliometrics
    owes its systematic development mainly to D.J.D. Price and Eugene Garfield, as
    founders. The few works conducted before the 1950s are usually relegated to prehistory.
    This paper documents how the systematic counting of publications originated with
    psychologists. In the early 1900s, psychologists began collecting statistics on
    their discipline. Publications came to be counted in addresses, reviews and histories
    of psychology for several decades. The aim was to contribute to the advancement
    of psychology. Far from being a negligible output of a prehistoric type, both
    the volume and the systematicness of these efforts are witnesses to what should
    be considered as pioneering work, and their authors considered as forerunners
    to bibliometrics.

  abstract: Over the past few years, data mining has moved from corporations to other
    organizations. This paper looks at the integration of data mining in digital library
    services. First, bibliomining, or the combination of bibliometrics and data mining
    techniques to understand library services, is defined and the concept explored.
    Second, the conceptual frameworks for bibliomining from the viewpoint of the library
    decision-maker and the library researcher are presented and compared. Finally,
    a research agenda to resolve many of the common bibliomining issues and to move
    the field forward in a mindful manner is developed. The result is not only a roadmap
    for understanding the integration of data mining in digital library services,
    but also a template for other cross-discipline data mining researchers to follow
    for systematic exploration in their own subject domains. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

    frequency is used to measure publication “shape” or pattern and output, citations

    journal publications with the highest P, books with the highest CPP, and insignificant
    SC and UP. Comparisons to several non-controversial scientific literatures suggest
    that these findings may be common to other controversial scientific literatures.

  abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this article is to describe Maurice Line ‘ s
    continuing interest in bibliometrics and in its possible application to library
    problems since the 1970s. He has especially emphasized two strands. One is the
    concept of obsolescence and how it applies in practice. The other is citation
    studies of the social sciences, which tend to have been ignored in comparison
    with the sciences. He has particularly explored the limitations that need to be
    taken into account when trying to apply bibliometric ideas in practical contexts.
    Design/methodology/approach - An analysis of Line ‘ s publications on bibliometrics
    led to a selection of major themes in his writings. A subsequent study of the
    publications of others who wrote on this topic over the same period provided a
    framework for assessing his work. Findings - Maurice Line played an important
    role in the development of this area of bibliometrics, though he slightly modified
    some of his early ideas as time has passed. Originality/value - Provides a background
    to Maurice Line ‘ s interest in bibliometrics since the 1970s.

  abstract: 'The introduction of bibliometric (and other) ranking is an answer to
    legitimation pressures on the higher education and research system. After years
    of hesitation by scientists, science administrators and even politicians in many
    of the industrialized countries, the implementation of bibliometrics based (and
    other types of) rankings for institutions of higher education and research is
    now being introduced on a full scale. What used to be an irritation to the parties
    concerned has suddenly become a fad. In contrast to this rather sudden enthusiasm,
    there is very little reflection on the impacts of this practice on the system
    itself. So far empirical data on the impact of bibliometric rankings seem to be
    available only for two cases: Australia and the British research assessment exercise
    (RA-E). Thus, the actual steering effects of bibliometric rankings, the reactions
    of the system are largely unknown. Rankings are in urgent demand by politics.
    The intended effect is to create competition among institutions of higher learning
    and research and thereby to increase their efficiency. The rankings are supposed
    to identify excellence in these institutions and among researchers. Unintended
    effects may be ‘oversteering’, either by forcing less competitive institutions
    to be closed down or by creating oligopolies whose once achieved position of supremacy
    cannot be challenged anymore by competitors. On the individual level the emergence
    of a kind of ‘chart’ of highly cited stars in science can already be observed
    (ISI HighlyCited.com). With the spread of rankings the business administration
    paradigm and culture is diffused through the academic system. The commercialization
    of ranking is most pronounced in the dependence of the entire practice on commercial
    providers of the pertinent data. As products like IST’s Essential Science Indicators
    become available, their use in the context of evaluation tasks is increasing rapidly.
    The future of the higher education and research system rests on two pillars: traditional
    peer review and ranking. The goal must be to have a system of informed peer review
    which combines the two. However, the politicized use of numbers (citations, impact
    factors, funding etc.) appears unavoidable.'

  abstract: Bibliometrics is a field of research that examines bodies of knowledge
    within and across disciplines. Citation analysis, a component of bibliometrics,
    focuses on the quantitative assessment of citation patterns within a body of literature.
    Citation analysis has been used in social work to examine the quantity and the
    impact of the work of individuals and academic institutions. This paper presents
    a selective review of these uses of bibliometrics within social work.

  abstract: The assessment of scholarship assumes a central role in the evaluation
    of individual faculty, educational programs and academic fields. Because the production
    and assessment of scholarship is so central to the faculty role, it is incumbent
    upon decision makers to strive to make assessments of scholarship fair and equitable.
    This paper will focus on an approach to the assessment of the quantity and impact
    of the most important Subset of an individual’s scholarship-peer-reviewed journal
    articles. The primary goal of this paper is to stimulate discussion regarding
    scholarship assessment in hiring, reappointment, tenure and promotion decisions.

    in the use of bibliographic analytic technology, and in particular its use in
    Substantive decision making around promotion and tenure. Questions are raised
    concerning the continued use of scholarly energy for bibliometric analysis Of
    Subtly different settings. The recommendation is offered that future efforts in
    bibliometrics Must target methods to reduce methodological shortcomings. These
    include clarifying the metric used to “Count” sole/multiple authorship, and to
    evaluate the “merit” of manuscripts as well as journals in which they appear.
    Finally, the fundamental meaning of the information produced in these analyses
    (i.e., the validity of the measure) must be clearly presented in order for it
    to be credibly used.

  abstract: The paper introduces bibliometrics to the research area of knowledge organization-more
    precisely in relation to construction and maintenance of thesauri. As such, the
    paper reviews related work that has been of inspiration for the assembly of a
    semi-automatic, bibliometric-based, approach for construction and maintenance.
    Similarly, the paper discusses the methodical considerations behind the approach.
    Eventually, the semi-automatic approach is used to verify the applicability of
    bibliometric methods as a supplement to construction and maintenance of thesauri.
    In the context of knowledge organization, the paper outlines two fundamental approaches
    to knowledge organization, that is, the manual intellectual approach and the automatic
    algorithmic approach. Bibliometric methods belong to the automatic algorithmic
    approach, though bibliometrics do have special characteristics that are substantially
    different from other methods within this approach.

  abstract: 'During recent decades, several actions have been taken to build up Mexico’s
    science manpower base. Thousands of scholarships have been awarded to Mexicans
    to pursue postgraduate studies abroad. However, the number of PhD-holders the
    country expected to have by the beginning of the third millenniumm is still low
    despite the large amount of money the country has been investing in the training
    of doctoral students: \$US 250,000 each. Therefore, we attempted to analyse the
    performance of the 1995 Mexican scholarship recipients awarded by the National
    Council for Science and Technology of Mexico for study abroad in all disciplines,
    assuming that many of them will contribute to the development of the Mexican science
    base after taking their knowledge back home. The visibility of the 680 study-abroad
    scholarship recipients was measured through the ISI Web of Science. The esteem
    measure was obtained from Mexico’s National Researchers’ System (SNI) the Mexican
    government recognition - data. As little or nothing is known about the performance
    of the Mexican government scholarship programme, this study provides information
    pertinent to this complex and controversial issue. The data reveals facts that
    might stimulate rethinking of the national science policy regarding support for
    doctoral training.'

  abstract: The author surveyed a set of ten scholarly journals that publish the mainstream
    of papers in the field of Scientometrics, Informetrics, and Bibliometrics (SIB).
    The survey is limited only to the research articles published in the field for
    the two decades period 1981-2000. Each journal was examined issue by issue for
    the institutional affiliations of contributing authors. Institutional rankings
    for the total period and the two decade periods; 1981-1990 and 1991-2000 were
    determined by awarding credit to the authors’ institutions based on authorship.
    In the composite of ten journals, the University Sheffield (England), the University
    of North Carolina (USA), the University of Leiden (Netherlands), the City University
    of London (England), the National Institute of Science, Technology and Development
    Studies (India), the University of Sussex (England), the University of Illinois
    (USA), the University of Michigan (USA), the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Library
    (Hungary), and Indiana University (USA) emerged as the ten most productive institutions
    for the period 1981-2000.

  abstract: Identifying the users and impact of research is important for research
    performers, managers, evaluators, and sponsors. It is important to know whether
    the audience reached is the audience desired. It is useful to understand the technical
    characteristics of the other research/development/applications impacted by the
    originating research, and to understand other characteristics (names, organizations,
    countries) of the users impacted by the research. Because of the many indirect
    pathways through which fundamental research can impact applications, identifying
    the user audience and the research impacts can be very complex and time consuming.
    The purpose of this article is to describe a novel approach for identifying the
    pathways through which research can impact other research, technology development,
    and applications, and to identify the technical and infrastructure characteristics
    of the user population. A novel literature-based approach was developed to identify
    the user community and its characteristics. The research performed is characterized
    by one or more articles accessed by the Science Citation Index (SCI) database,
    beccause the SCI’s citation-based structure enables the capability to perform
    citation studies easily.

  abstract: 'Database tomography (DT) is a textual database analysis system consisting
    of two major components: (1) algorithms for extracting multiword phrase frequencies
    and phrase proximities (physical closeness of the multiword technical phrases)
    from any type of large textual database, to augment (2) interpretative capabilities
    of the expert human analyst. DT has been used to derive technical intelligence
    from a variety of textual database sources, most recently the published technical
    literature as exemplified by the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Engineering
    Compendex (EC). Phrase frequency analysis (the occurrence frequency of multiword
    technical phrases) provides the pervasive technical themes of the topical databases
    of interest, and phrase proximity analysis provides the relationships among the
    pervasive technical themes. In the structured published literature databases,
    bibliometric analysis of the database records supplements the DT results by identifying
    the recent most prolific topical area authors; the journals that contain numerous
    topical area papers; the institutions that produce numerous topical area papers;
    the keywords specified most frequently by the topical area authors; the authors
    whose works are cited most frequently in the topical area papers; and the particular
    papers and journals cited most frequently in the topical area papers. This review
    paper summarizes: (1) the theory and background development of DT; (2) past published
    and unpublished literature study results; (3) present application activities;
    (4) potential expansion to new DT applications. In addition, application of DT
    to technology forecasting is addressed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

  abstract: 'Since Vassily V. Nalimov coined the term ‘scientometrics’ in the 1960s,
    this term has grown in popularity and is used to describe the study of science:
    growth, structure, interrelationships and productivity. Scientometrics is related
    to and has overlapping interests with bibliometrics and informetrics. The terms
    bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics refer to component fields related
    to the study of the dynamics of disciplines as reflected in the production of
    their literature, Areas of study range from charting changes in the output of
    a scholarly field through time and across countries, to the library collection
    problem of maintaining control of the output, and to the low publication productivity
    of most researchers. These terms are used to describe similar and overlapping
    methodologies. The origins and historical survey of the development of each of
    these terms are presented. Profiles of the usage of each of these terms over time
    are presented, using an appropriate subject category of databases on the DIALOG
    information service. Various definitions of each of the terms are provided from
    an examination of the literature. The size of the overall literature of these
    fields is determined and the growth and stabilisation of both the dissertation
    and non-dissertation literature are shown. A listing of the top journals in the
    three fields are given, as well as a list of the major reviews and bibliographies
    that have been published over the years.'

  abstract: 'Background. Spain is one of the few European countries to have recently
    totally incorporated the study of nursing into the university sector. Bibliometric
    studies may be of a great help for the consolidation of nursing research. Aim
    of the study. The aim of this paper is to describe bibliographic references in
    Spanish nursing research papers and their evolution over a decade. Method. The
    method consists of a retrospective bibliometric study of a sample (cluster sampling)
    of 622 research papers (original papers and review papers), which were contained
    in the Spanish nursing journals Enfermeria Cientifica, Revista ROL de Enfermeria,
    Enfermeria Clinica and Enfermeria Integral, and published from 1985 to 1994. The
    journal Nursing Research was selected for qualitative comparative purposes. A
    series of classic bibliometric indexes were used. Results. The mean of references
    per paper is 10.64 +/- 10.42; this increased over time (P \< 0.001). Review papers
    have more references (P \< 0.001). Price index (percentage of references published
    during the last 5 years) is 44% and the Insularity (percentage of references published
    in same country as the article) is 55%. References to journals predominate (58.6%),
    with a growing tendency for references to Spanish nursing journals, although they
    are still scarce (18.1% of the references to journals). Spanish is the language
    of most of the references (60.3%), the second language being English (36.1%).
    Conclusions. Bibliographic references in Spanish nursing research papers are scarce
    and not very specific: this happens both in regard to Nursing Research and to
    publications in other national and international science areas. However, there
    is an increasing tendency of references (including references to nursing journals)
    in the period analysed. The age of the references places Spanish nursing in ail
    intermediate position between the ‘hard’ sciences and the humanities; and, according
    to the type of documentation used, we find it halfway between experimental and
    natural sciences, and technologies and social sciences. There has been a slight
    increase in references in English in recent years.'

  abstract: 'The idea of a unified citation index to the literature of science was
    first outlined by Eugene Garfield \[I\] in 1955 in the journal Science. Science
    Citation Index has since established itself as the gold standard for scientific
    information retrieval. It has also become the database of choice for citation
    analysts and evaluative bibliometricians worldwide. As scientific publication
    moves to the web, and novel approaches to scholarly communication and peer review
    establish themselves, new methods of citation and link analysis will emerge to
    capture often liminal expressions of peer esteem, influence and approbation. The
    web thus affords bibliometricians rich opportunities to apply and adapt their
    techniques to new contexts and content: the age of ‘bibliometric spectroscopy’
    \[2\] is dawning.'

  abstract: Electronic publishing developments and new information technology in general
    will affect the main functions of scientific communication. Most changes however
    will be primarily technological hut not conceptual. Publication via journals of
    high reputation is in most fields of science crucial to receive professional recognition.
    That will remain so in the “electronic era”. A much more revolutionary change
    in science will be the increasing availability and sharing of research data.

    and patenting citation patterns in a group of twelve US pharmaceutical companies
    over a 13-year period. Our initial findings suggest that firms self-cite a great
    deal, and that they rely heavily on public science. In addition, we found that
    Merck and Co. is the most frequently cited company in both the science and technology
    areas, though somewhat less so in technology. The managerial implications, particularly
    from a knowledge perspective, are discussed as well as some suggestions for future
    research.

  abstract: The Australian government has expressed a continuing interest in the assessment
    of research productivity as a basic element of a ‘rationalised’ research funding
    process. Bibliometric analyses are among the techniques that the government uses
    to evaluate the quality of research performance. Like many other disciplines,
    sociology is a target of these assessments. This paper presents data to demonstrate
    how Australian sociology might measure up if subjected to an inquiry using these
    methods. Data are provided on the standing of Australian sociology internationally
    and on the research contributions of major Australian universities. Several important
    methodological issues are reviewed and discussed. It is concluded that Australian
    sociologists would be well served by becoming active participants in the ongoing
    national debate over the assessment of research performance and the allocation
    of funding for tertiary education and science.

  abstract: This paper makes the assumption that Norwegian patenting in the US reflects
    a quasi-universe of Norwegian technological capabilities. Based on this assumption,
    the paper combines a “patent-bibliometrics” and a “technometrics” approach to
    study other relevant bodies of knowledge these capabilities build upon. In order
    to study interactions at the “science-technology-innovation interface”, the paper
    maps the citation patterns that radiate from the patent population (1990-96) to
    other areas of technology (patent-citations) and to science-bases (citations to
    Non-Patent Literature or NPL). The study identifies important technology-technology
    links that involve machinery, process-engineering and chemical and significant
    science-technology links that involve pharmaceuticals and instruments.

  abstract: The international scientific cooperation between Latin American countries,
    the European Union and the United States have been studied through their publications
    in the Science Citation Index. A total of 17,473 documents coauthored between
    1991-95 has been analysed. Bibliometric indicators were used to identify the collaboration
    patterns of each Latin American country, productivity, principal subject of the
    cooperation and partners. As a whole, coauthored papers amount to 32% of mainstream
    scientific articles of Latin America although a great heterogeneity can be observed.
    Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela and Colombia account for more than
    95% of the copublished articles. Around 44% of the copublications have been with
    USA and another 44% with EU, while copublications among Latin American countries
    represent 5,4% and 6,6% joint publications with the three regions. The most frequent
    case was the coauthorship between two countries (15,298 documents). Collaborative
    papers have grown along the period studied, particularly multilateral collaborations.
    Physics, including Astrophysics, Biomedicine, Clinical Medicine and Agriculture
    were the fields that present higher collboration rates.

  abstract: This paper examines the process of the institutionalization of research
    in physics in India. In order to do so, it employs bibliometric data such as research
    publications in physics research journals between 1900 and 1950. This data is
    then analyzed to obtain certain indicators that are pointers of the aspects of
    the institutionalization of research in physics in India. The four aspects of
    institutionalization studied here are important for the researches of those adopting
    sociological approaches in the study of the history of sciences. Thus the bibliometric
    techniques employed complements the efforts of historians of science studying
    the professionalization of physics research in India, and in this case those dealing
    with disciplines like physics. Further, the bibliometric data helps substantiate
    the claims of historians of science that the years 1905 to 1935 were particularly
    important for the history of physics in India. The conclusions of historians are
    based on success stories of a few leading physicists of the time. Within an institutional
    framework, this paper argues that there was a larger ground swell indicative of
    the emergence of a physics research community in India.

    and bibliometrics. The first part was published in (FID no. 2 and dealt with the
    scholarly communication model. The second part will deal with the scholarly communication
    process. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest both in scholarly
    communication as a research area and in the application of bibliometrics as a
    research method This article discusses the scholarly communication process from
    the following three points of view: (I) scholarly communication participants the
    human element in scholarly communication; (2) scholarly communication media -
    the carrier element in scholarly communication; (3) information diffusion in scholarly
    communication - the message element in scholarly communication. Scientific research
    is all information consuming as well as producing human activity of which output
    outperforms its input. The study of characteristics of information processes represents
    a central topic in the discipline of science and also in Bibliometrics. The channels
    of information either in the classical printed or in electronic form are the scientific
    journals, which contain about 70 % of the new information, produced in natural
    sciences. Conditions and intensity of the information flow between persons, teams,
    institutions, countries, etc. have been widely studied. Information emitters,
    being absorbers as well, may form a social network, which is frequently and thoroughly
    studied by many authors.'

  abstract: 'Slow development of bibliometric theory may be due in part to neglect
    of the unit of analysis - the objects described by variables and about which inferences
    are made. Problems include: inferences are often made on units other than those
    sampled, leading to inappropriate conclusions; units in literature reviews and
    meta-analysis are often not comparable, thus hindering cumulation of knowledge;
    confusion when names of sampling units in one study might also be the names of
    variables in other studies - e.g., no. of citations (variable) to papers (sampling
    unit) and no. of papers (variable) in journals (sampling unit); loss of information
    about the unit of analysis, means and variances when data are aggregated. If theory
    is to advance, scientometrics needs a generic definition of the unit of analysis,
    a complete list of all known units - classified and structured, meta-analyses,

  abstract: In a short report, the personal view of the author on descriptive bibliometrics
    and the methods used are given. The paper illustrates with seven graphs the different
    results and gives some interpretations of the development of systematic zoology
    as a descriptive science and a basic knowledge base for biodiversity research.
    Methods of descriptive bibliometry can be used in both fields of research. Professor
    R.T. Bottle has presented masterpieces in bibliometrics \[1, 2, 3\] which have
    stimulated, and will continue to stimulate, research for many years.

  abstract: In our 1975 monograph ‘’Evaluative Bibliometrics’’ we discussed the many
    uses of publication and citation analysis in the evaluation of scientific activities,
    and some of the basic statistical properties of the scientific literature, particularly
    the skewnness of the distributions of publications and citations, reference time
    distributions, and various anomalies in the citation patterns from one country
    to another. Over the last ten years we have devoted much of our energy to the
    development of an analogous research base and infrastructure for patent bibliometrics,
    that is for the use of patents, and patent citations in the evaluation of technological
    activities. There are remarkable similarities between literature bibliometrics
    and patent bibliometrics, and they are both applicable to the same wide ranges
    of problems. This paper will show that there are striking similarities between
    literature and patent distributions of national productivity, inventor productivity,
    referencing cycles, citation impact and within country citation preferences.

  abstract: This literature review covers multiple authorship as it relates to research
    on scholarly publishing within library and information science. The article examines
    the research on collaboration in other disciplines and considers the methodological
    impact of various ways of allotting ‘’credit’’ for multi-authored works and the
    relationships between multiple authorship and other publication variables, such
    as quality and impact. Given the complex relationship between collaboration and
    productivity, the concomitant use of nonbibliometric methods of studying collaboration,
    as well as the application of meta-analysis, is suggested.

  genre: Article
  abstract: This paper reports the preliminary results of a research project that
    investigates the effectiveness of a new concept and technique suitable for incorporation
    into the design of interfaces for information retrieval. The idea, which I call
    colinked descriptors, is borrowed from the analogous idea in bibliometrics–cocited
    references. Suppose that an information seeker has identified two concepts to
    represent his information problem, consults a thesaurus, and finds two candidate
    descriptors to represent them. Colinked descriptors are defined as descriptors
    that are semantically linked to both candidate descriptors, according to the thesaurus.
    By analogy with cocited reference searching, these colinked descriptors–typically
    a small subset of all terms linked to one or the other of the original candidate
    terms–should be much more likely to lead to bibliographic records that will be
    found relevant by the information seeker. Preliminary results suggest that the
    technique is extremely effective. As a retrieval technique, colinked descriptors
    can easily be incorporated into information retrieval interfaces, front-end systems,
    or stand-alone, pre-search systems.

  abstract: Historians of bibliometrics have neglected legal bibliometrics almost
    completely. Yet bibliometrics, citation indexing, and citation analysis all appear
    to have been practiced in the legal field long before they were introduced into
    scientific literature. Publication counts are found in legal writings as early
    as 1817. Citation indexing originated with “tables of cases cited,” which date
    at least as far back as 1743. A full-fledged citation index book was published
    in 1860. Two ambitious citation analyses of court decisions appeared in 1894 and
    1895.

  abstract: Analysis of papers published by the Indian scientists in Indian and overseas
    journals is given. Analysis of the 12156 papers included in the corporate author
    index of the Science Citation Index (SCI) for 1987 indicates that a large portion
    (45%) of the Indian scientific output was from 26 institutions. Out of these institutions
    also, only 11 contributed 3414 (28%) papers. However, the scientific activity
    is widely scattered. There is not much variation in the scientific output of different
    disciplines except mathematical sciences where the research output appears to
    be quite low. It is pointed out that the papers published by the Indian researchers
    appeared in 1442 journals, of which 11 are the Indian journals while the rest
    are published from the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden,
    etc. Physical sciences, inorganic chemistry, neurosciences, biochemistry and molecular
    biology appear to be the strong areas of Indian science. 12% of the research papers
    have been published in journals with impact factor (IF) \> 2, while only 1% appeared
    in the journals having IF \> 4.

  abstract: Scholars in all fields who are engaged in the publication process must
    submit their work to appropriate journals. Selecting the appropriate journal can
    be a challenging task. This article argues that citation analysis may be an effective
    tool of journal selection. Citation patterns can be used to determine the extent
    of bibliographic coupling between an author’s unpublished article and journals
    in the author’s field. The article could then be submitted to a journal with a
    similar pattern of citations. Evidence from published articles in economics indicates
    that this technique is able to determine the journal in which an article is published.
